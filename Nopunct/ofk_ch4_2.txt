Perhaps I ought to explain added the badger lowering his papers nervously and looking at the Wart over the top of them that all embryos look very much the same They are what you are before you are born  and whether you are going to be a tadpole or a peacock or a cameleopard or a man when you are an embryo you just look like a peculiarly repulsive and helpless human being I continue as follows:  The embryos stood in front of God with their feeble hands clasped politely over their stomachs and their heavy heads hanging down respectfully and God addressed them  He said: Now you embryos here you are all looking exactly the same and We are going to give you the choice of what you want to be When you grow up you will get bigger anyway but We are pleased to grant you another gift as well You may alter any parts of yourselves into anything which you think would be useful to you in later life For instance at the moment you cannot dig Anybody who would like to turn his hands into a pair of spades or garden forks is allowed to do so Or to put it another way at present you can only use your mouths for eating Anybody who would like to use his mouth as an offensive weapon can change it by asking and be a corkindrill or a sabre toothed tiger Now then step up and choose your tools but remember that what you choose you will grow into and will have to stick to  All the embryos thought the matter over politely and then one by one they stepped up before the eternal throne They were allowed two or three specializations so that some chose to use their arms as flying machines and their mouths as weapons or crackers or drillers or spoons while others selected to use their bodies as boats and their hands as oars We badgers thought very hard and decided to ask three boons We wanted to change our skins for shields our mouths for weapons and our arms for garden forks These boons were granted Everybody specialized in one way or another and some of us in very queer ones For instance one of the desert lizards decided to swap his whole body for blotting paper and one of the toads who lived in the drouthy antipodes decided simply to be a water bottle  The asking and granting took up two long days  they were the fifth and sixth so far as I remember  and at the very end of the sixth day just before it was time to knock off for Sunday they had got through all the little embryos except one This embryo was Man   Well Our little man said God You have waited till the last and slept on your decision and We are sure you have been thinking hard all the time What can We do for you   Please God said the embryo I think that You made me in the shape which I now have for reasons best known to Yourselves and that it would be rude to change If I am to have my choice I will stay as I am I will not alter any of the parts which You gave me for other and doubtless inferior tools and I will stay a defenceless embryo all my life doing my best to make myself a few feeble implements out of the wood iron and the other materials which You have seen fit to put before me If I want a boat I will try to construct it out of trees and if I want to fly I will put together a chariot to do it for me Probably I have been very silly in refusing to take advantage of Your kind offer but I have done my very best to think it over carefully and now hope that the feeble decision of this small innocent will find favour with Yourselves   Well done exclaimed the Creator in delighted tones  Here all you embryos come here with your beaks and whatnots to look upon Our first Man He is the only one who has guessed Our riddle out of all of you and We have great pleasure in conferring upon him the Order of Dominion over the Fowls of the Air and the Beasts of the Earth and the Fishes of the Sea Now let the rest of you get along and love and multiply for it is time to knock off for the week end As for you Man you will be a naked tool all your life though a user of tools You will look like an embryo till they bury you but all the others will be embryos before your might Eternally undeveloped you will always remain potential in Our image able to see some of Our sorrows and to feel some of Our joys We are partly sorry for you Man but partly hopeful Run along then and do your best And listen Man before you go    Well asked Adam turning back from his dismissal   We were only going to say said God shyly twisting Their hands together Well We were just going to say God bless you  Its a good story said the Wart doubtfully I like it better than Merlyns one about the Rabbi And it is interesting too  The badger was covered with confusion  No no dear boy You exaggerate A minor parable at most Besides I fear it is a trifle optimistic  How  Well it is true that man has the Order of Dominion and is the mightiest of the animals  if you mean the most terrible one  but I have sometimes doubted lately whether he is the most blessed  I dont think Sir Ector is very terrible  All the same if even Sir Ector was to go for a walk beside a river not only would the birds fly from him and the beasts run away from him but the very fish would dart to the other side They dont do this for each other  Man is the king of the animals  Perhaps Or ought one to say the tyrant And then again we do have to admit that he has a quantity of vices  King Pellinore has not got many  He would go to war if King Uther declared one Do you know that Homo sapiens is almost the only animal which wages war  Ants do  Dont say Ants do in that sweeping way dear boy There are more than four thousand different sorts of them and from all those kinds I can only think of five which are belligerent There are the five ants one termite that I know of and Man  But the packs of wolves from the Forest Sauvage attack our flocks of sheep every winter  Wolves and sheep belong to different species my friend True warfare is what happens between bands of the same species Out of the hundreds of thousands of species I can only think of seven which are belligerent Even Man has a few varieties like the Esquimaux and the Gypsies and the Lapps and certain Nomads in Arabia who do not do it because they do not claim boundaries True warfare is rarer in Nature than cannibalism Dont you think that is a little unfortunate  Personally said the Wart I should have liked to go to war if I could have been made a knight I should have liked the banners and the trumpets the flashing armour and the glorious charges And oh I should have liked to do great deeds and be brave and conquer my own fears Dont you have courage in warfare Badger and endurance and comrades whom you love  The learned animal thought for a long time gazing into the fire  In the end he seemed to change the subject  Which did you like best he asked the ants or the wild geese  22 King Pellinore arrived for the important week end in a high state of flurry  I say he exclaimed do you know Have you heard Is it a secret what  Is what a secret what they asked him  Why the King cried his majesty You know about the King  Whats the matter with the King inquired Sir Ector You dont say hes comin down to hunt with those demned hounds of his or anythin like that  Hes dead cried King Pellinore tragically Hes dead poor fellah and cant hunt any more  Sir Grummore stood up respectfully and took off his cap of maintenance  The King is dead he said Long live the King  Everybody else felt they ought to stand up too and the boys nurse burst into tears  There there she sobbed His loyal highness dead and gone and him such a respectful gentleman Manys the illuminated picture Ive cut out of him from the Illustrated Missals  aye and stuck up over the mantel From the time when he was in swaddling bands right through them world towers till he was a visiting the dispersed areas as the worlds Prince Charming there wasnt a picture of im but I had it out aye and give im a last thought o nights  Compose yourself Nannie said Sir Ector  It is solemn isnt it said King Pellinore what Uther the Conqueror 1066 to 1216  A solemn moment said Sir Grummore The King is dead Long live the King  We ought to pull down the curtains said Kay who was always a stickler for good form or half mast the banners  Thats right said Sir Ector Somebody go and tell the sergeant at arms  It was obviously the Warts duty to execute this command for he was now the junior nobleman present so he ran out cheerfully to find the sergeant Soon those who were left in the solar could hear a voice crying out Nah then one two special mourning fer is lite majesty lower awai on the command Two and then the flapping of all the standards banners pennons pennoncells banderolls guidons streamers and cognizances which made gay the snowy turrets of the Forest Sauvage  How did you hear asked Sir Ector  I was pricking through the purlieus of the forest after that Beast you know when I met with a solemn friar of orders grey and he told me Its the very latest news  Poor old Pendragon said Sir Ector  The King is dead said Sir Grummore solemnly Long live the King  It is all very well for you to keep on mentioning that my dear Grummore exclaimed King Pellinore petulantly but who is this King what that is to live so long what accordin to you  Well his heir said Sir Grummore rather taken aback Our blessed monarch said the Nurse tearfully never had no hair Anybody that studied the loyal family knowed that  Good gracious exclaimed Sir Ector But he must have had a next of kin  Thats just it cried King Pellinore in high excitement Thats the excitin part of it what No hair and no next of skin and whos to succeed to the throne Thats what my friar was so excited about what and why he was asking who could succeed to what what What  Do you mean to tell me exclaimed Sir Grummore indignantly that there aint no King of Gramarye  Not a scrap of one cried King Pellinore feeling important And there have been signs and wonders of no mean might  I think its a scandal said Sir Grummore God knows what the dear old country is comin to Due to these lollards and communists no doubt  What sort of signs and wonders asked Sir Ector Well there has appeared a sort of sword in a stone what in a sort of a church Not in the church if you see what I mean and not in the stone but that sort of thing what like you might say  I dont know what the Church is coming to said Sir Grummore  Its in an anvil explained the King The Church No the sword  But I thought you said the sword was in the stone No said King Pellinore The stone is outside the church  Look here Pellinore said Sir Ector You have a bit of a rest old boy and start again Here drink up this horn of mead and take it easy  The sword said King Pellinore is stuck through an anvil which stands on a stone It goes right through the anvil and into the stone The anvil is stuck to the stone The stone stands outside a church Give me some more mead  I dont think thats much of a wonder remarked Sir Grummore What I wonder at is that they should allow such things to happen But you cant tell nowadays what with all these Saxon agitators  My dear fellah cried Pellinore getting excited again its not where the stone is what that Im trying to tell you but what is written on it what where it is  What  Why on its pommel  Come on Pellinore said Sir Ector You just sit quite still with your face to the wall for a minute and then tell us what you are talkin about Take it easy old boy No need for hurryin You sit still and look at the wall theres a good chap and talk as slow as you can  There are words written on this sword in this stone outside this church cried King Pellinore piteously and these words are as follows Oh do try to listen to me you two instead of interruptin all the tune about nothin for it makes a mans head go ever so  What are these words asked Kay  These words say this said King Pellinore so far as I can understand from that old friar of orders grey  Go on do said Kay for the King had come to a halt  Go on said Sir Ector what do these words on this sword in this anvil in this stone outside this church say  Some red propaganda no doubt remarked Sir Grummore  King Pellinore closed his eyes tight extended his arms in both directions and announced in capital letters Whoso Pulleth Out This Sword of this Stone and Anvil is Right wise King Born of All England  Who said that asked Sir Grummore  But the sword said it like I tell you  Talkative weapon remarked Sir Grummore sceptically  It was written on it cried the King angrily Written on it in letters of gold  Why didnt you pull it out then asked Sir Grummore  But I tell you that I wasnt there All this that I am telling you was told to me by that friar I was telling you of like I tell you  Has this sword with this inscription been pulled out inquired Sir Ector  No whispered King Pellinore dramatically Thats where the whole excitement comes in They cant pull this sword out at all although they have all been tryin like fun and so they have had to proclaim a tournament all over England for New Years Day so that the man who comes to the tournament and pulls out the sword can be King of all England for ever what I say  Oh father cried Kay The man who pulls that sword out of the stone will be the King of England Cant we go to the tournament father and have a shot  Couldnt think of it said Sir Ector  Long way to London said Sir Grummore shaking his head  My father went there once said King Pellinore  Kay said Oh surely we could go When I am knighted I shall have to go to a tournament somewhere and this one happens at just the right date All the best people will be there and we should see the famous knights and great kings It does not matter about the sword of course but think of the tournament probably the greatest there has ever been in Gramarye and all the things we should see and do Dear father let me go to this tourney if you love me so that I may bear away the prize of all in my maiden fight  But Kay said Sir Ector I have never been to London  All the more reason to go I believe that anybody who does not go for a tournament like this will be proving that he has no noble blood in his veins Think what people will say about us if we do not go and have a shot at that sword They will say that Sir Ectors family was too vulgar and knew it had no chance  We all know the family has no chance said Sir Ector that is for the sword  Lot of people in London remarked Sir Grummore with a wild surmise So they say  He took a deep breath and goggled at his host with eyes like marbles  And shops added King Pellinore suddenly also beginning to breathe heavily  Dang it cried Sir Ector bumping his horn mug on the table so that it spilled Lets all go to London then and see the new King  They rose up as one man  Why shouldnt I be as good a man as my father exclaimed King Pellinore  Dash it all cried Sir Grummore After all damn it all it is the capital  Hurray shouted Kay  Lord have mercy said the nurse  At this moment the Wart came in with Merlyn and everybody was too excited to notice that if he had not been grown up now he would have been on the verge of tears  Oh Wart cried Kay forgetting for the moment that he was only addressing his squire and slipping back into the familiarity of their boyhood What do you think We are all going to London for a great tournament on New Years Day  Are we  Yes and you will carry my shield and spears for the jousts and I shall win the palm of everybody and be a great knight  Well I am glad we are going said the Wart for Merlyn is leaving us too  Oh we shant need Merlyn  He is leaving us repeated the Wart  Leavin us asked Sir Ector I thought it was we that were leavin  He is going away from the Forest Sauvage  Sir Ector said Come now Merlyn whats all this about I dont understand all this a bit  I have come to say Good bye Sir Ector said the old magician Tomorrow my pupil Kay will be knighted and the next week my other pupil will go away as his squire I have outlived my usefulness here and it is time to go  Now now dont say that said Sir Ector I think youre a jolly useful chap whatever happens You just stay and teach me or be the librarian or something Dont you leave an old man alone after the children have flown  We shall all meet again said Merlyn There is no cause to be sad  Dont go said Kay  I must go replied their tutor We have had a good time while we were young but it is in the nature of Time to fly There are many things in other parts of the kingdom which I ought to be attending to just now and it is a specially busy time for me Come Archimedes say Good bye to the company  Good bye said Archimedes tenderly to the Wart  Good bye said the Wart without looking up at all  But you cant go cried Sir Ector not without a months notice  Cant I replied Merlyn taking up the position always used by philosophers who propose to dematerialize He stood on his toes while Archimedes held tight to his shoulder  began to spin on them slowly like a top  spun faster and faster till he was only a blur of greyish light  and in a few seconds there was no one there at all  Good bye Wart cried two faint voices outside the solar window  Good bye said the Wart for the last time  and the poor fellow went quickly out of the room  23 The knighting took place in a whirl of preparations Kays sumptuous bath had to be set up in the box room between two towel horses and an old box of selected games which contained a worn out straw dart board  it was called flechette in those days  because all the other rooms were full of packing The nurse spent the whole time constructing new warm pants for everybody on the principle that the climate of any place outside the Forest Sauvage must be treacherous to the extreme and as for the sergeant he polished all the armour till it was quite brittle and sharpened the swords till they were almost worn away At last it was time to set out  Perhaps if you happen not to have lived in the Old England of the twelfth century or whenever it was and in a remote castle on the borders of the Marches at that you will find it difficult to imagine the wonders of their journey The road or track ran most of the time along the high ridges of the hills or downs and they could look down on either side of them upon the desolate marshes where the snowy reeds sighed and the ice crackled and the duck in the red sunsets quacked loud on the winter air The whole country was like that Perhaps there would be a moory marsh on one side of the ridge and a forest of a hundred thousand acres on the other with all the great branches weighted in white They could sometimes see a wisp of smoke among the trees or a huddle of buildings far out among the impassable reeds  and twice they came to quite respectable towns which had several inns to boast of but on the whole it was an England without civilization The better roads were cleared of cover for a bow shot on either side of them lest the traveller should be slain by hidden thieves  They slept where they could sometimes in the hut of some cottager who was prepared to welcome them sometimes in the castle of a brother knight who invited them to refresh thelmselves sometimes in the firelight and fleas of a dirty little hovel with a bush tied to a pole outside it  this was the sign board used at that time by inns  and once or twice on the open ground all huddled together for warmth between their grazing chargers Wherever they went and wherever they slept the east wind whistled in the reeds and the geese went over high in the starlight honking at the stars  London was full to the brim If Sir Ector had not been lucky enough to own a little land in Pie Street on which there stood a respectable inn they would have been hard put to it to find a lodging But he did own it and as a matter of fact drew most of his dividends from that source so they were able to get three beds between the five of them They thought thelmselves fortunate  On the first day of the tournament Sir Kay managed to get them on the way to the lists at least an hour before the jousts could possibly begin He had lain awake all night imagining how he was going to beat the best barons in England and he had not been able to eat his breakfast Now he rode at the front of the cavalcade with pale cheeks and Wart wished there was something he could do to calm him down  For country people who only knew the dismantled tilting ground of Sir Ectors castle the scene which met their eyes was ravishing It was a huge green pit in the earth about as big as the arena at a football match It lay ten feet lower than the surrounding country with sloping banks and the snow had been swept off it It had been kept warm with straw which had been cleared off that morning and now the close worn grass sparkled green in the white landscape Round the arena there was a world of colour so dazzling and moving and twinkling as to make one blink ones eyes The wooden grandstands were painted in scarlet and white The silk pavilions of famous people pitched on every side were azure and green and saffron and chequered The pennons and pennoncells which floated everywhere in the sharp wind were flapping with every colour of the rainbow as they strained and slapped at their flag poles and the barrier down the middle of the arena itself was done in chessboard squares of black and white Most of the combatants and their friends had not yet arrived but one could see from those few who had come how the very people would turn the scene into a bank of flowers and how the armour would flash and the scalloped sleeves of the heralds jig in the wind as they raised their brazen trumpets to theirlips to shake the fleecy clouds of winter with joyances and fanfares  Good heavens cried Sir Kay I have left my sword at home  Cant joust without a sword said Sir Grummore Quite irregular  Better go and fetch it said Sir Ector You have time  My squire will do said Sir Kay What a damned mistake to make I Here squire ride hard back to the inn and fetch my sword You shall have a shilling if you fetch it in time  The Wart went as pale as Sir Kay was and looked as if he were going to strike him Then he said It shall be done master and turned his ambling palfrey against the stream of newcomers He began to push his way toward their hostelry as best he might  To offer me money cried the Wart to himself To look down at this beastly little donkey  affair off his great charger and to call me Squire Oh Merlyn give me patience with the brute and stop me from throwing his filthy shilling in his face  When he got to the inn it was closed Everybody had thronged to see the famous tournament and the entire household had followed after the mob Those were lawless days and it was not safe to leave your house  or even to go to sleep in it  unless you were certain that it was impregnable The wooden shutters bolted over the downstairs windows were two inches thick and the doors were double barred  Now what do I do asked the Wart to earn my shilling  He looked ruefully at the blind little inn and began to laugh  Poor Kay he said All that shilling stuff was only because he was scared and miserable and now he has good cause to be Well he shall have a sword of some sort if I have to break into the Tower of London  How does one get hold of a sword he continued Where can I steal one Could I waylay some knight even if I am mounted on an ambling pad and take his weapons by force There must be some swordsmith or armourer in a great town like this whose shop would be still open  He turned his mount and cantered off along the street There was a quiet churchyard at the end of it with a kind of square in front of the church door In the middle of the square there was a heavy stone with an anvil on it and a fine new sword was stuck through the anvil  Well said the Wart I suppose it is some sort of war memorial but it will have to do I am sure nobody would grudge Kay a war memorial if they knew his desperate straits  He tied his reins round a post of the lych gate strode up the gravel path and took hold of the sword  Come sword he said I must cry your mercy and take you for a better cause  This is extraordinary said the Wart I feel strange when I have hold of this sword and I notice everything much more clearly Look at the beautiful gargoyles of the church and of the monastery which it belongs to See how splendidly all the famous banners in the aisle are waving How nobly that yew holds up the red flakes of its timbers to worship God How clean the snow is I can smell something like fetherfew and sweet briar  and is it music that I hear  It was music whether of pan pipes or of recorders and the light in the churchyard was so clear without being dazzling that one could have picked a pin out twenty yards away  There is something in this place said the Wart There are people Oh people what do you want  Nobody answered him but the music was loud and the light beautiful  People cried the Wart I must take this sword It is not for me but for Kay I will bring it back  There was still no answer and Wart turned back to the anvil He saw the golden letters which he did not read and the jewels on the pommel flashing in the lovely light  Come sword said the Wart  He took hold of the handles with both hands and strained against the stone There was a melodious consort on the recorders but nothing moved  The Wart let go of the handles when they were beginning to bite into the palms of his hands and stepped back seeing stars  It is well fixed he said  He took hold of it again and pulled with all his might The music played more strongly and the light all about the churchyard glowed like amethysts; but the sword still stuck  Oh Merlyn cried the Wart help me to get this weapon  There was a kind of rushing noise and a long chord played along with it All round the churchyard there were hundreds of old friends They rose over the church wall all together like the Punch and Judy ghosts of remembered days and there were badgers and nightingales and vulgar crows and hares and wild geese and falcons and fishes and dogs and dainty unicorns and solitary wasps and corkindrills and hedgehogs and griffins and the thousand other animals he had met They loomed round the church wall the lovers and helpers of the Wart and they all spoke solemnly in turn Some of them had come from the banners in the church where they were painted in heraldry some from the waters and the sky and the fields about  but all down to the smallest shrew mouse had come to help on account of love Wart felt his power grow  Put your back into it said a Luce (or pike) off one of the heraldic banners as you once did when I was going to snap you up Remember that power springs from the nape of the neck  What about those forearms asked a Badger gravely that are held together by a chest Come along my dear embryo and find your tool  A Merlin sitting at the top of the yew tree cried out  Now then Captain Wart what is the first law of the foot I thought I once heard something about never letting go  Dont work like a stalling woodpecker urged a Tawny Owl affectionately Keep up a steady effort my duck and you will have it yet  A white front said Now Wart if you were once able to fly the great North Sea surely you can co ordinate a few little wing muscles here and there Fold your powers together with the spirit of your mind and it will come out like butter Come along Homo sapiens for all we humble friends of yours are waiting here to cheer  The Wart walked up to the great sword for the third time He put out his right hand softly and drew it out as gently as from a scabbard  There was a lot of cheering a noise like a hurdy gurdy which went on and on In the middle of this noise after a long time he saw Kay and gave him the sword The people at the tournament were making a frightful row  But this is not my sword said Sir Kay  It was the only one I could get said the Wart The inn was locked  It is a nice looking sword Where did you get it  I found it stuck in a stone outside a church  Sir Kay had been watching the tilting nervously waiting for his turn He had not paid much attention to his squire  That is a funny place to find one he said  Yes it was stuck through an anvil  What cried Sir Kay suddenly rounding upon him Did you just say this sword was stuck in a stone  It was said the Wart It was a sort of war memorial  Sir Kay stared at him for several seconds in amazement opened his mouth shut it again licked his lips then turned his back and plunged through the crowd He was looking for Sir Ector and the Wart followed after him  Father cried Sir Kay come here a moment  Yes my boy said Sir Ector Splendid falls these professional chaps do manage Why whats the matter Kay You look as white as a sheet  Do you remember that sword which the King of England would pull out  Yes  Well here it is I have it It is in my hand I pulled it out  Sir Ector did not say anything silly He looked at Kay and he looked at the Wart Then he stared at Kay again long and lovingly and said We will go back to the church  Now then Kay he said when they were at the church door He looked at his first born kindly but straight between the eyes Here is the stone and you have the sword It will make you the King of England You are my son that I am proud of and always will be whatever you do Will you promise me that you took it out by your own might  Kay looked at his father He also looked at the Wart and at the sword  Then he handed the sword to the Wart quite quietly He said I am a liar Wart pulled it out As far as the Wart was concerned there was a time after this in which Sir Ector kept telling him to put the sword back into the stone  which he did  and in which Sir Ector and Kay then vainly tried to take it out The Wart took it out for them and stuck it back again once or twice After this there was another time which was more painful  He saw that his dear guardian was looking quite old and powerless and that he was kneeling down with difficulty on a gouty knee  Sir said Sir Ector without looking up although he was speaking to his own boy  Please do not do this father said the Wart kneeling down also Let me help you up Sir Ector because you are making me unhappy  Nay nay my lord said Sir Ector with some very feeble old tears I was never your father nor of your blood but I wote well ye are of an higher blood than I wend ye were  Plenty of people have told me you are not my father said the Wart but it does not matter a bit  Sir said Sir Ector humbly will ye be my good and gracious lord when ye are King Dont said the Wart  Sir said Sir Ector I will ask no more of you but that you will make my son your foster  brother Sir Kay seneschal of all your lands  Kay was kneeling down too and it was more than the Wart could bear  Oh do stop he cried Of course he can be seneschal if I have got to be this King and oh father dont kneel down like that because it breaks my heart Please get up Sir Ector and dont make everything so horrible Oh dear oh dear I wish I had never seen that filthy sword at all And the Wart also burst into tears  24 Perhaps there ought to be a chapter about the coronation The barons naturally kicked up a fuss but as the Wart was prepared to go on putting the sword into the stone and pulling it out again till doomsday and as there was nobody else who could do the thing at all in the end they had to give in A few of the Gaelic ones revolted who were quelled later but in the main the people of England and the partizans like Robin were glad to settle down They were sick of the anarchy which had been their portion under Uther Pendragon: sick of overlords and  feudal giants of knights who did what they pleased of racial discrimination and of the rule of Might as Right  The coronation was a splendid ceremony What was still more splendid it was like a birthday or Christmas Day Everybody sent presents to the Wart for his prowess in having learned to pull swords out of stones and several burghers of the City of London asked him to help them in taking stoppers out of unruly bottles unscrewing taps which had got stuck and in other household emergencies which had got beyond their control The Dog Boy and Wat clubbed together and sent him a mixture for the distemper which contained quinine and was absolutely priceless Lyo lyok sent him some arrows made with her own feathers Cavall came simply and gave him his heart and soul The Nurse of the Forest Sauvage sent a cough mixture thirty dozen handkerchiefs all marked and a pair of combinations with a double chest The sergeant sent him his crusading medals to be preserved by the nation Hob lay awake in agony all night and sent off Cully with brand new white leather jesses silver varvels and silver bell Robin and Marian went on an expedition which took them six weeks and sent a whole gown made out of the skins of pine martens Little John added a yew bow seven feet long which he was quite unable to draw An anonymous hedgehog sent four or five dirty leaves with fleas on them The Questing Beast and King Pellinore put their heads together and sent some of their most perfect fewmets wrapped up in the green leaves of spring in a golden horn with a red velvet baldrick Sir Grummore sent a gross of spears with the old school crest on all of them The cooks tenants villeins and retainers of The Castle of the Forest Sauvage who were given an angel each and sent up for the ceremony in an ox  drawn char a banc at Sir Ectors charge brought an enormous silver model of cow Crumbrocke who had won the championship for the third time and Ralph Passelewe to sing at the coronation banquet Archimedes sent his own great great grandson so that he could sit on the back of the Kings throne at dinner and make messes on the floor The Lord Mayor and Aldermen of the City of London subscribed for a spacious aquarium mews cum  menagerie at the Tower in which all the creatures were starved one day a week for the good of their stomachs  and here for the fresh food good bedding constant attention and every modern convenience the Warts friends resorted in their old age on wing and foot and fin for the sunset of their happy lives The citizens of London sent fifty million pounds to keep the menagerie up and the Ladies of Britain constructed a pair of black velvet carpet slippers with the Warts initials embroidered in gold Kay sent his own record griffin with honest love There were many other tasteful presents from various barons archbishops princes landgraves tributary kings corporations popes sultans royal commissions urban district councils czars beys mahatmas and so forth but the nicest present of all was sent most affectionately by his own guardian old Sir Ector This present was a dunces cap rather like a pharaohs serpent which you lit at the top end The Wart lit it and watched it grow When the flame had quite gone out Merlyn was standing before him in his magic hat  Well Wart said Merlyn here we are  or were   again How nice you look in your crown I was not allowed to tell you before or since but your father was or will be King Uther Pendragon and it was I myself disguised as a beggar who first carried you to Sir Ectors castle in your golden swaddling bands I know all about your birth and parentage and who gave you your real name I know the sorrows before you and the joys and how there will never again be anybody who dares to call you by the friendly name of Wart In future it will be your glorious doom to take up the burden and to enjoy the nobility of your proper title: so now I shall crave the privilege of being the very first of your subjects to address you with it  as my dear liege lord King Arthur  Will you stay with me for a long time asked the Wart not understanding much of this  Yes Wart said Merlyn Or rather as I should say (or is it have said) Yes King Arthur  Incipit Liber Secundus  THE QUEEN OF AIR AND DARKNESS When shall I be dead and rid Of the wrong my father did How long how long till spade and hearse Put to sleep my mothers curse  1 There was a round tower with a weather cock on it The weather cock was a carrion crow with an arrow in its beak to point to the wind  There was a circular room at the top of the tower curiously uncomfortable It was draughty There was a closet on the east side which had a hole in the floor This hole commanded the outer doors of the tower of which there were two and people could drop stones through it when they were besieged Unfortunately the wind used to come up through the hole and go pouring out of the unglazed shot windows or up the chimney  unless it happened to be blowing the other way in which case it went downward It was like a wind tunnel A second nuisance was that the room was full of peat smoke not from its own fire but from the fire in the room below The complicated system of draughts sucked the smoke down the chimney The stone walls sweated in damp weather The furniture itself was uncomfortable It consisted solely of heaps of stones  which were handy for throwing down the hole  together with a few rusty Genoese cross bows with their bolts and a pile of turfs for the unlit fire The four children had no bed If it had been a square room they might have had a cupboard bed but as it was they had to sleep on the floor  where they covered thelmselves with straw and plaids as best they could  The children had erected an amateur tent over their heads out of the plaids and under this they were lying close together telling a story They could hear their mother stoking the fire in the room below which made them whisper for fear that she could hear It was not exactly that they were afraid of being beaten if she came up They adored her dumbly and uncritically because her character was stronger than theirs Nor had they been forbidden to talk after bedtime It was more as if she had brought them up  perhaps through indifference or through laziness or even through some kind of possessive cruelty  with an imperfect sense of right and wrong It was as if they could never know when they were being good or when they were being bad  They were whispering in Gaelic Or rather they were whispering in a strange mixture of Gaelic and of the Old Language of chivalry  which had been taught to them because they would need it when they were grown They had little English In later years when they became famous knights at the court of the great king they were to speak English perfectly   all of them except Gawaine who as the head of the clan was to cling to a Scots accent on purpose to show that he was not ashamed of his birth  Gawaine was telling the story because he was the eldest They lay together like thin strange secret frogs their bodies well boned and ready to fill out into toughness as soon as they might be given decent nourishment They were fair haired Gawaines was bright red and Gareths whiter than hay They ranged from ten years old to fourteen and Gareth was the youngest of the four Gaheris was a stolid child Agravaine the next after Gawaine was the bully of the family  he was shifty inclined to cry and frightened of pain It was because he had a good imagination and used his head more than the others  Long time past my heroes Gawaine was saying before ourselves were born or thought of there was a beautiful grandmother at us called Igraine  She is the Countess of Cornwall said Agravaine  Our grandmother is the Countess of Cornwall agreed Gawaine and the bloody King of England fell in love with her  His name was Uther Pendragon said Agravaine  Who is at telling this story asked Gareth angrily Close your mouth  King Uther Pendragon continued Gawaine let send for the Earl and Countess of Cornwall    Our Grandfather and Granny said Gaheris    and he proclaimed to them that they must stay with him at his house in the Tower of London Then when they were at staying with him therein he asked our Granny that she would become the wife of himself instead of being with our Grandfather at all But the chaste and beautiful Countess of Cornwall    Granny said Gaheris  Gareth exclaimed: Sorrow take it will you give us peace There was a muffled argument punctuated by squeaks bumps and complaining remarks  The chaste and beautiful Countess of Cornwall resumed Gawaine spurned the advances of King Uther Pendragon and she told our Grandfather about it She said: I suppose we were sent for that I should be dishonoured Wherefore husband I counsel you that we depart from hence suddenly that we may ride all night to our own castle So they went out of the Kings rath in the middle night    At dead of night Gareth corrected    when all the people of the house had gone on sleep and there they saddled their prancing fire eyed swift footed symmetrical large lipped small headed vehement steeds by the light of a dark lantern and they rode away into Cornwall as fast as they could go  It was a terrible ride said Gaheris  They killed the horses underneath them said Agravaine  So they did not then said Gareth Our Grandfather and Granny would not have ridden any horses to kill them  Did they asked Gaheris  No they did not said Gawaine after considering But they nearly did so  He went on with the story  When King Uther Pendragon learned what had happened in the morning he was wonderly wroth  Wood wroth suggested Gareth  Wonderly wroth said Gawaine King Uther Pendragon was wonderly wroth He said I will have that Earl of Cornwalls head in a pie dish by my halidome So he sent our Grandfather a letter which bid him to stuff him and garnish him for within forty days he would fetch him out of the strongest castle that he had  There were two castles at him said Agravaine haughtily They were the Castle Tintagil and the Castle Terrabil  So the Earl of Cornwall put our Granny in Tintagil and he himself went into Terrabil and King Uther Pendragon came to lay them siege  And there cried Gareth unable to contain himself the king pight many pavilions and there was great war made on both parties and much people slain  A thousand suggested Gaheris Two thousand at least said Agravaine We of the Gael would not have slain less than two thousand In truth it was a million probably  So when our Grandfather and Granny were winning the sieges and it looked as if King Uther would be utterly defeated there came along a wicked magician called Merlyn    A nigromancer said Gareth  And this nigromancer would you believe it by means of his infernal arts succeeded in putting the treacherous Uther Pendragon inside our Grannys Castle Granda immediately made a sortie out of Terrabil but he was slain in the battle    Treacherously  And the poor Countess of Cornwall    The chaste and beautiful Igraine    Our Granny      was captured prisoner by the blackhearted southron faithless King of the Dragon and then in spite of it that she had three beautiful daughters already whatever    The lovely Cornwall Sisters Aunt Elaine Aunt Morgan And Mammy  And if she had these lovely daughters she was forced into marrying the King of England   the man who had slain her husband  They considered the enormous English wickedness in silence overwhelmed by its denouement It was their mothers favourite story on the rare occasions when she troubled to tell them one and they had learned it by heart Finally Agravaine quoted a Gaelic proverb which she had also taught them  Four things he whispered that a Lothian cannot trust  a cows horn a horses hoof a dogs snarl and an Englishmans laugh  They moved in the straw uneasily listening to some secret movements in the room below  The room underneath the story tellers was lit by a single candle and by the saffron light of its peat fire It was a poor room for a royal one but at least it had a bed in it  the great four  poster which was used as a throne during the daytime An iron cauldron with three legs was boiling over the fire The candle stood in front of a sheet of polished brass which served as a mirror There were two living beings in the chamber a Queen and a cat Both of them had black hair and blue eyes  The black cat lay on its side in the firelight as if it were dead This was because its legs were tied together like the legs of a roe deer which is to be carried home from the hunt It had given up struggling and now lay gazing into the fire with slit eyes and heaving sides curiously resigned Or else it was exhausted  for animals know when they have come to the end Most of them have a dignity about dying denied to human beings This cat with the small flames dancing in its oblique eyes was perhaps seeing the pageant of its past eight lives reviewing them with an animals stoicism beyond hope or fear  The Queen picked up the cat She was trying a well known piseog to amuse herself or at any rate to pass the time while the men were away at the war It was a method of becoming invisible She was not a serious witch like her sister Morgan le Fay  for her head was too empty to take any great art seriously even if it were the black one She was doing it because the little magics ran in her blood   as they did with all the women of her race  In the boiling water the cat gave some horrible convulsions and a dreadful cry Its wet fur bobbed in the steam gleaming like the side of a speared whale as it tried to leap or to swim with its bound feet Its mouth opened hideously showing the whole of its pink gullet and the sharp white cat teeth like thorns After the first shriek it was not able to articulate but only to stretch its jaws Later it was dead  Queen Morgause of Lothian and Orkney sat beside the cauldron and waited Occasionally she stirred the cat with a wooden spoon The stench of boiling fur began to fill the room A watcher would have seen in the nattering peat light what an exquisite creature she was tonight: her deep big eyes her hair glinting with dark lustre her full body and her faint air of watchfulness as she listened for the whispering in the room above  Gawaine said: Revenge  They had done no harm to King Pendragon  They had only asked to be left in peace  It was the unfairness of the rape of their Cornish grandmother which was hurting Gareth  the picture of weak and innocent people victimized by a resistless tyranny  the old tyranny of the Gall  which was felt like a personal wrong by every crofter of the Islands Gareth was a generous boy He hated the idea of strength against weakness It made his heart swell as if he were going to suffocate Gawaine on the other hand was angry because it had been against his family He did not think it was wrong for strength to have its way but only that it was intensely wrong for anything to succeed against his own clan He was neither clever nor sensitive but he was loyal  stubbornly sometimes and even annoyingly and stupidly so in later life For him it was then as it was always to be: Up Orkney Right or Wrong The third brother Agravaine was moved because it was a matter which concerned his mother He had curious feelings about her which he kept to himself As for Gaheris he did and felt what the others did  The cat had come to pieces The long boiling had shredded its meat away until there was nothing in the cauldron except a deep scum of hair and grease and gobbets Underneath the white bones revolved in the eddies of the water the heavy ones lying still and the airy membranes lifting gracefully like leaves in an autumn wind The Queen wrinkling her nose slightly in the thick stench of unsalted broth strained the liquid into a second pot On top of the flannel strainer there was left a sediment of cat a sodden mass of matted hair and meat shreds and the delicate bone She blew on the sediment and began turning it over with the handle of the spoon prodding it to let the heat out Later she was able to sort it with her fingers  The Queen knew that every pure black cat had a certain bone in it which if it were held in the mouth after boiling the cat alive was able to make you invisible But nobody knew precisely even in those days which the bone was This was why the magic had to be done in front of a mirror so that the right one could be found by practice  It was not that Morgause courted invisibility  indeed she would have detested it because she was beautiful But the men were away It was something to do an easy and well known charm Besides it was an excuse for lingering with the mirror  The Queen scraped the remains of her cat into two heaps one of them a neat pile of warm bones the other a miscellaneous lump which softly steamed Then she chose one of the bones and lifted it to her red lips cocking the little finger She held it between her teeth and stood in front of the polished brass looking at herself with sleepy pleasure She threw the bone into the fire and fetched another  There was nobody to see her It was strange in these circumstances the way in which she turned and turned from mirror to bone pile always putting a bone in her mouth and looking at herself to see if she had vanished and throwing the bone away She moved so gracefully as if she were dancing as if there really was somebody to see her or as if it were enough that she should see herself  Finally but before she had tested all the bones she lost interest She threw the last ones down impatiently and tipped the mess out of the window not caring where it fell Then she  smoored the fire stretched herself on the big bed with a strange motion and lay there in the darkness for a long time without sleeping  her body moving discontentedly  And this my heroes concluded Gawaine is the reason why we of Cornwall and Orkney must be against the Kings of England ever more and most of all against the clan Mac Pendragon  It is why our Da has gone away to fight against King Arthur whatever for Arthur is a Pendragon Our Mammy said so  And we must keep the feud living forever said Agravaine because Mammy is a Cornwall Dame Igraine is our Granny  We must avenge our family  Because our Mammy is the most beautiful woman in the high ridged extensive ponderous pleasantly turning world  And because we love her  Indeed they did love her Perhaps we all give the best of our hearts uncritically  to those who hardly think about us in return  2 On the battlements of their castle at Camelot during an interval of peace between the two Gaelic Wars the young king of England was standing with his tutor looking across the purple wastes of evening A soft light flooded the land below them and the slow river wound between venerable abbey and stately castle while the flaming water of sunset reflected spires and turrets and pennoncells hanging motionless in the calm air  The world was laid out before the two watchers like a toy for they were on a high keep which dominated the town At their feet they could see the grass of the outer bailey  it was horrible looking down on it  and a small foreshortened man with two buckets on a yoke making his way across to the menagerie They could see further off at the gatehouse which was not so horrible to look at because it was not vertically below the night guard taking over from the sergeant They were clicking their heels and saluting and presenting pikes and exchanging passwords as merrily as a marriage bell  but it was done in silence for the two because it was so far below They looked like lead soldiers the little gallow glasses and their footsteps could not sound upon the luscious sheep nibbled green Then outside the curtain wall there was the distant noise of old wives bargaining and brats bawling and corporals quaffing and a few goats mixed with it and two or three lepers in white hoods ringing bells as they walked and the swishing robes of nuns who were kindly visiting the poor two by two and a fight going on between some gentlemen who were interested in horses On the other side of the river which ran directly beneath the castle wall there was a man ploughing in the fields with his plough tied to the horses tail The wooden plough squeaked There was a silent person near him fishing for salmon with worms  the rivers were not polluted in those days  and further off there was a donkey giving his musical concert to the coming night All these noises came up to the two on the tower smally as though they were listening  through the wrong end of a megaphone Arthur was a young man just on the threshold of life He had fair hair and a stupid face or at any rate there was a lack of cunning in it It was an open face with kind eyes and a reliable or faithful expression as though he were a good learner who enjoyed being alive and did not believe in original sin He had never been unjustly treated for one thing so he was kind to other people  The King was dressed in a robe of velvet which had belonged to Uther the Conqueror his father trimmed with the beards of fourteen kings who had been vanquished in the olden days Unfortunately some of these kings had had red hair some black some pepper and salt while their growth of beard had been uneven The trimming looked like a feather boa The moustaches were stuck on round the buttons  Merlyn had a white beard which reached to his middle horn rimmed spectacles and a conical hat He wore it in compliment to the Saxon serfs of the country whose national headgear was either a kind of diving cap or the Phrygian cap or else this cone of straw  The two of them were speaking sometimes as the words came to them between spells of listening to the evening:  Well said Arthur I must say it is nice to be a king It was a splendid battle  Do you think so  Of course it was splendid Look at the way Lot of Orkney ran after I had begun to use Excalibur  He got you down first  That was nothing It was because I was not using Excalibur As soon as I drew my trusty sword they ran like rabbits  They will come again said the magician all six The Kings of Orkney Garloth Gore Scotland The Tower and the Hundred Knights have started already  in fact the Gaelic Confederation You must remember that your claim to the throne is hardly a conventional one  Let them come replied the King I dont mind I will beat them properly this time and then we will see who is master  The old man crammed his beard in his mouth and began to chew it as he generally did when he was put about He bit through one of the hairs which stuck between two teeth He tried to lick it off then took it out with his fingers Finally he began curling it into two points  I suppose you will learn some day he said but God knows it is heartbreaking uphill work Oh  Yes cried Merlyn passionately Oh oh oh That is all you can say Oh oh oh Like a schoolboy I shall cut off your head if you are not careful Cut it off It would be a good thing if you did I should not have to keep on tutoring at any rate  Arthur shifted his elbow on the battlement and looked at his ancient friend  What is the matter Merlyn he asked Have I been doing something wrong I am sorry if I have The magician uncurled his beard and blew his nose It is not so much what you are doing he said It is how you are thinking If there is one thing I cant stand it is stupidity I always say that stupidity is the Sin against the Holy Ghost I know you do Now you are being sarcastic The King took him by the shoulder and turned him round Look he said what is wrong Are you in a bad temper If I have done something stupid tell me Dont be in a bad temper  It had the effect of making the aged nigromant angrier than before  Tell you he exclaimed And what is going to happen when there is nobody to tell you Are you never going to think for yourself What is going to happen when I am locked up in this wretched tumulus of mine I should like to know  I didnt know there was a tumulus in it Oh hang the tumulus What tumulus What am I supposed to be talking about  Stupidity said Arthur It was stupidity when we started Exactly  Well its no good saying Exactly You were going to say something about it  I dont know what I was going to say about it You put one in such a passion with all your this and that that I am sure nobody would know what they were talking about for two minutes together How did it begin  It began about the battle  Now I remember said Merlyn That is exactly where it did begin  I said it was a good battle So I recollect  Well it was a good battle he repeated defensively It was a jolly battle and I won it myself and it was fun  The magicians eyes veiled thelmselves like a vultures as he vanished inside his mind There was silence on the battlements for several minutes while a pair of peregrines that were being hacked in a nearby field flew over their heads in a playful chase crying out Kik kik kik their bells ringing Merlyn looked out of his eyes once more  It was clever of you he said slowly to win the battle  Arthur had been taught that he ought to be modest and he was too simple to notice that the vulture was going to pounce  Oh well It was luck  Very clever repeated Merlyn How many of your kerns were killed I dont remember No  Kay said    The King stopped in the middle of the sentence and looked at him  Well he said It was not fun then I had not thought The tally was more than seven hundred They were all kerns of course None of the knights were injured except the one who broke his leg falling off the horse  When he saw that Arthur was not going to answer the old fellow went on in a bitter voice  I was forgetting he added that you had some really nasty bruises  Arthur glared at his finger nails I hate you when you are a prig Merlyn was charmed  Thats the spirit he said putting his arm through the Kings and smiling cheerfully Thats more like it Stand up for yourself thats the ticket Asking advice is the fatal thing Besides I wont be here to advise you fairly soon  What is this you keep talking about about not being here and the tumulus and so on  It is nothing I am due to fall in love with a girl called Nimue in a short time and then she learns my spells and locks me up in a cave for several centuries It is one of those things which are going to happen  But Merlyn how horrible To be stuck in a cave for centuries like a toad in a hole We must do something about it  Nonsense said the magician What was I talking about  About this maiden  I was talking about advice and how you must never take it Well I am going to give you some now I advise you to think about battles and about your realm of Gramarye and about the sort of things a king has to do Will you do that  I will Of course I will But about this girl who learns your spells  You see it is a question of the people as well as of the kings When you said about the battle being a lovely one you were thinking like your father I want you to think like yourself so that you will be a credit to all this education I have been giving you  afterwards when I am only an old man locked up in a hole  Merlyn  There there I was playing for sympathy Never mind I said it for effect As a matter of fact it will be charming to have a rest for a few hundred years and as for Nimue I am looking backward to her a good deal No no the important thing is this thinking for yourself business and the matter of battles Have you ever thought seriously about the state of your country for instance or are you going to go on all your life being like Uther Pendragon After all you are the King of the place  I have not thought very much  No Then let me do some thinking for you Suppose we think about your Gaelic friend Sir Bruce Sans Piti�  That fellow  Exactly And why do you say it like that  He is a swine He goes murdering maidens  and as soon as a real knight turns up to rescue them he gallops off for all he is worth He breeds special fast horses so that nobody can catch him and he stabs people in the back Hes a marauder I would kill him at once if I could catch him  Well said Merlyn I dont think he is very different from the others What is all this chivalry anyway It simply means being rich enough to have a castle and a suit of armour and then when you have them you make the Saxon people do what you like The only risk you run is of getting a few bruises if you happen to come across another knight Look at that tilt you saw between Pellinore and Grummore when you were small It is this armour that does it All the barons can slice the poor people about as much as they want and it is a days work to hurt each other and the result is that the country is devastated Might is Right thats the motto Bruce Sans Piti� is only an example of the general situation Look at Lot and Nentres and Uriens and all that Gaelic crew fighting against you for the Kingdom Pulling swords out of stones is not a legal proof of paternity I admit but the kings of the Old Ones are not fighting you about that They have rebelled although you are their feudal sovereign simply because the throne is insecure Englands difficulty we used to say is Irelands opportunity This is their chance to pay off racial scores and to have some blood letting as sport and to make a bit of money in ransoms Their turbulence does not cost them anything thelmselves because they are dressed in armour  and you seem to enjoy it too But look at the country Look at the barns burnt and dead mens legs sticking out of ponds and horses with swelled bellies by the roadside and mills falling down and money buried and nobody daring to walk abroad with gold or ornaments on their clothes That is chivalry nowadays That is the Uther Pendragon touch And then you talk about a battle being fun  I was thinking of myself  I know  I ought to have thought of the people who had no armour  Quite  Might isnt Right is it Merlyn  Aha replied the magician beaming Aha You are a cunning lad Arthur but you wont catch your old tutor like that You are trying to put me in a passion by making me do the thinking But I am not to be caught I am too old a fox for that You will have to think the rest yourself Is might right  and if not why not give reasons and draw a plan Besides what are you going to do about it  What began the King but he saw the gathering frown  Very well he said I will think about it  And he began thinking stroking his upper lip where the moustache was going to be  There was a small incident before they left the keep The man who had been carrying the two buckets to the menagerie came back with his buckets empty He passed directly under them looking small on his way to the kitchen door Arthur who had been playing with a loose stone which he had dislodged from one of the machicolations got tired of thinking and leaned over with the stone in his hand  How small Curselaine looks  He is tiny  I wonder what would happen if I dropped this stone on his head  Merlyn measured the distance  At thirty two feet per second he said I think it would kill him dead Four hundred g is enough to shatter the skull  I have never killed anybody like that said the boy in an inquisitive tone  Merlyn was watching  You are the King he said  Then he added Nobody can say anything to you if you try  Arthur stayed motionless leaning out with the stone in his hand Then without his body moving his eyes slid sideways to meet his tutors  The stone knocked Merlyns hat off as clean as a whistle and the old gentleman chased him featly down the stairs waving his wand of lignum vitae  Arthur was happy Like the man in Eden before the fall he was enjoying his innocence and fortune Instead of being a poor squire he was a king Instead of being an orphan he was loved by nearly everybody except the Gaels and he loved everybody in return  So far as he was concerned as yet there might never have been such a thing as a single particle of sorrow on the gay sweet surface of the dew glittering world  3 Sir Kay had heard stories about the Queen of Orkney and he was inquisitive about her  Who is Queen Morgause he asked one day I was told that she is beautiful What did these Old Ones want to fight us about And what is her husband like King Lot What is his proper name I heard somebody calling him the King of the Out Isles and then there are others who call him the King of Lothian and Orkney Where is Lothian Is it near Hy Brazil I cant understand what the revolt was about Everybody knows that the King of England is their feudal overlord I heard that she has four sons Is it true that she doesnt get on with her husband  They were riding back from a day on the mountain where they had been hunting grouse with the peregrines and Merlyn had gone with them for the sake of the ride He had become a vegetarian lately  an opponent of blood sports on principle  although he had gone through most of them during his thoughtless youth  and even now he secretly adored to watch the falcons for thelmselves Their masterly circles as they waited on  mere specks in the sky   and the bur r r with which they scythed on the grouse and the way in which the wretched quarry killed instantaneously went end over tip into the heather  these were a temptation to which he yielded in the uncomfortable knowledge that it was sin He consoled himself by saying that the grouse were for the pot But it was a shallow excuse for he did not believe in eating meat either  Arthur who was riding watchfully like a sensible young monarch withdrew his eye from a clump of whins which might have held an ambush in those early days of anarchy and cocked one eyebrow at his tutor He was wondering with half his mind which of Kays questions the magician would choose to answer but the other half was still upon the martial possibilities of the landscape He knew how far the falconers were behind them  the cadger carrying the hooded hawks on a square framework slung from his shoulders with a man at arms on either side  and how far in front was the next likely place for a William Rufus arrow Merlyn chose the second question Wars are never fought for one reason he said They are fought for dozens of reasons in a muddle It is the same with revolts  But there must have been a main reason said Kay Not necessarily  Arthur observed: We might have a trot now It is clear going for two miles since those whins and we can have a canter back again to keep with the men It would breathe the horses  Merlyns hat blew off They had to stop to pick it up Afterwards they walked their horses sedately in a row  One reason said the magician is the immortal feud of Gael and Gall The Gaelic Confederation are representatives of an ancient race which has been harried out of England by several races which are represented by you Naturally they want to be as nasty as possible to you when they can Racial history is beyond me said Kay Nobody knows which race is which They are all serfs in any case The old man looked at him with something like amusement  One of the startling things about the Norman he said is that he really does not know a single thing about anybody except himself And you Kay as a Norman gentleman carry the peculiarity to its limit I wonder if you even know what a Gael is Some people call them Celts  A celt is a kind of battle axe said Arthur surprising the magician with this piece of information more than he had been surprised for several generations For it was true in one of the meanings of the word although Arthur ought not to have known it  Not that kind of celt I am talking about the people Lets stick to calling them Gaels I mean the Old Ones who live in Brittany and Cornwall and Wales and Ireland and Scotland Picts and that  Picts asked Kay I think I have heard about Picts Pictures They were painted blue  And I am supposed to have managed your education The King said thoughtfully: Would you mind telling me about the races Merlyn I suppose I ought to understand the situation if there has to be a second war  This time it was Kay who looked surprised  Is there to be a war he asked This is the first Ive heard of it I thought the revolt was crushed last year  They have made a new confederation since they went home with five new kings which makes them eleven altogether The new ones belong to the old blood too They are Clariance of North Humberland Idres of Cornwall Cradelmas of North Wales Brandegoris of Stranggore and Anguish of Ireland It will be a proper war Im afraid  And all about races said his foster brother in disgust Still it may be fun  The King ignored him  Go on he said to Merlyn I want you to explain  Only he added quickly as the magician opened his mouth not too many details  Merlyn opened his mouth and shut it twice before he was able to comply with this restriction  About three thousand years ago he said the country you are riding through belonged to a Gaelic race who fought with copper hatchets Two thousand years ago they were hunted west by another Gaelic race with bronze swords A thousand years ago there was a Teuton invasion by people who had iron weapons but it didnt reach the whole of the Pictish Isles because the Romans arrived in the middle and got mixed up with it The Romans went away about eight hundred years ago and then another Teuton invasion  of people mainly called Saxons  drove the whole ragbag west as usual The Saxons were just beginning to settle down when your father the Conqueror arrived with his pack of Normans and that is where we are today Robin Wood was a Saxon partizan  I thought we were called the British Isles  So we are People have got the Bs and Ps muddled up Nothing like the Teuton race for confusing its consonants In Ireland they are still chattering away about some people called Fomorians who were really Pomeranians while  Arthur interrupted him at the critical moment  So it comes to this he said that we Normans have the Saxons for serfs while the Saxons once had a sort of under serfs who were called the Gaels  the Old Ones In that case I dont see why the Gaelic Confederation should want to fight against me  as a Norman king   when it was really the Saxons who hunted them and when it was hundreds of years ago in any case  You are under rating the Gaelic memory dear boy They dont distinguish between you The Normans are a Teuton race like the Saxons whom your father conquered So far as the ancient Gaels are concerned they just regard both your races as branches of the same alien people who have driven them north and west  Kay said definitely: I cant stand any more history After all we are supposed to be grown up If we go on we shall be doing dictation  Arthur grinned and began in the well remembered singsong voice: Barbara Celarent Darii Ferioque Prioris while Kay sang the next four lines with him antiphonically  Merlyn said: You asked for it  And now we have it  The main thing is that the war is going to happen because the Teutons or the Galls or whatever you call them upset the Gaels long ago  Certainly not exclaimed the magician I never said anything of the sort  They gaped  I said the war will happen for dozens of reasons not for one Another of the reasons for this particular war is because Queen Morgause wears the trousers Perhaps I ought to say the trews  Arthur asked painstakingly: Let me get this clear First I was given to understand that Lot and the rest had rebelled because they were Gaels and we were Galls but now I am told that it deals with the Queen of Orkneys trousers Could you be more definite  There is the feud of Gael and Gall which we have been talking about but there are other feuds too Surely you have not forgotten that your father killed the Earl of Cornwall before you were born Queen Morgause was one of the daughters of that Earl  The Lovely Cornwall Sisters observed Kay  Exactly You met one of them yourselves  Queen Morgan le Fay That was when you were friends with Robin Wood and you found her on a bed of lard The third sister was Elaine All three of them are witches of one sort or another though Morgan is the only one who takes it seriously  If my father said the King killed the Queen of Orkneys father then I think she has a good reason for wanting her husband to rebel against me  It is only a personal reason Personal reasons are no excuse for war  And furthermore the King continued if my race has driven out the Gaelic race then I think the Queen of Orkneys subjects have a good reason too  Merlyn scratched his chin in the middle of the beard with the hand which held the reins and pondered  Uther he said at length your lamented father was an aggressor So were his predecessors the Saxons who drove the Old Ones away But if we go on living backward like that we shall never come to the end of it The Old Ones thelmselves were aggressors against the earlier race of the copper hatchets and even the hatchet fellows were aggressors against some earlier crew of esquimaux who lived on shells You simply go on and on until you get to Cain and Abel But the point is that the Saxon Conquest did succeed and so did the Norman Conquest of the Saxons Your father settled the unfortunate Saxons long ago however brutally he did it and when a great many years have passed one ought to be ready to accept a status quo Also I would like to point out that the Norman Conquest was a process of welding small units into bigger ones  while the present revolt of the Gaelic Confederation is a process of disintegration They want to smash up what we may call the United Kingdom into a lot of piffling little kingdoms of their own That is why their reason is not what you might call a good one  He scratched his chin again and became wrathful  I never could stomach these nationalists he exclaimed The destiny of Man is to unite not to divide If you keep on dividing you end up as a collection of monkeys throwing nuts at each other out of separate trees  All the same said the King there seems to have been a good deal of provocation Perhaps I ought not to fight  And give in asked Kay more in amusement than dismay  I could abdicate  They looked at Merlyn who refused to meet their eyes He rode on staring straight in front of him munching his beard  Ought I to give in  You are the King said the old man stubbornly Nobody can say anything if you do  Later on he began to speak in a gentler tone  Did you know he asked rather wistfully that I was one of the Old Ones myself My father was a demon they say but my mother was a Gael The only human blood I have comes from the Old Ones Yet here I am denouncing their ideas of nationalism being what  their politicians would call a traitor  because by calling names they can score the cheap debating points And do you know another thing Arthur Life is too bitter already without territories and wars and noble feuds  4 The hay was safe and the corn would be ripe in a week They sat in the shade at the edge of a cornfield watching the dark brown people with their white teeth who were aimlessly busy in the sunlight rehanging their scythes sharpening their sickles and generally getting ready for the end of farm year It was peaceful in the fields which were close to the castle and no arrows needed to be apprehended While they watched the harvesters they stripped the half  ripe heads of corn with their fingers and bit the grain daintily tasting the furry milkiness of the wheat and the husky less generous flesh of the oats The pearly taste of barley would have been strange to them for it had not yet come to Gramarye  Merlyn was still explaining  When I was a young man he said there was a general idea that it was wrong to fight in wars of any sort Quite a lot of people in those days declared that they would never fight for anything whatever  Perhaps they were right said the King  No There is one fairly good reason for fighting  and that is if the other man starts it You see wars are a wickedness perhaps the greatest wickedness of a wicked species They are so wicked that they must not be allowed When you can be perfectly certain that the other man started them then is the time when you might have a sort of duty to stop him  But both sides always say that the other side started them  Of course they do and it is a good thing that it should be so At least it shows that both sides are conscious inside thelmselves that the wicked thing about a war is its beginning  But the reasons protested Arthur If one side was starving the other by some means or other  some peaceful economic means which were not actually warlike  then the starving side might have to fight its way out  if you see what I mean  I see what you think you mean said the magician but you are wrong There is no excuse for war none whatever and whatever the wrong which your nation might be doing to mine   short of war  my nation would be in the wrong if it started a war so as to redress it A murderer for instance is not allowed to plead that his victim was rich and oppressing him   so why should a nation be allowed to Wrongs have to be redressed by reason not by force  Kay said: Suppose King Lot of Orkney was to draw up his army all along the northern border what could our King here do except send his own army to stand on the same line Then supposing all Lots men drew their swords what could we do except draw ours The situation could be more complicated than that It seems to me that aggression is a difficult thing to be sure about  Merlyn was annoyed  Only because you want it to seem so he said Obviously Lot would be the aggressor for making the threat of force You can always spot the villain if you keep a fair mind In the last resort it is ultimately the man who strikes the first blow  Kay persisted with his argument  Let it be two men he said instead of two armies They stand opposite each other  they draw their swords pretending it is for some other reason  they move about so as to get the weak side of one another  they even make feints with their swords pretending to strike but not doing so Do you mean to tell me that the aggressor is the one who actually hits first  Yes if there is nothing else to decide by But in your case it is obviously the man who first took his army to the frontier  This first blow business brings it down to a matter of nothing Suppose they both struck at once or suppose you could not see which one gave the first blow because there were so many facing each other  But there nearly always is something else to decide by exclaimed the old man Use your common sense Look at this Gaelic revolt for example What reason has the King here for being an aggressor He is their feudal overlord already It isnt sensible to pretend that he is making the attack People dont attack their own possessions  I certainly dont feel  said Arthur as if I had started it Indeed I didnt know it was going to start until it had I suppose that was due to my having been brought up in the country  Any reasoning man continued his tutor ignoring the interruption who keeps a steady mind can tell which side is the aggressor in ninety wars out of a hundred He can see which side is likely to benefit by going to war in the first place and that is a strong reason for suspicion He can see which side began to make the threat of force or was the first to arm itself And finally he can often put his finger on the one who struck the first blow  But supposing said Kay that one side was the one to make the threat while the other side was the one to strike the first blow  Oh go and put your head in a bucket Im not suggesting that all of them can be decided I was saying from the start of the argument that there are many wars in which the aggression is as plain as a pike staff and that in those wars at any rate it might be the duty of decent men to fight the criminal If you arent sure that he is the criminal  and you must sum it up for yourself with every ounce of fairness you can muster  then go and be a pacifist by all means I recollect that I was a fervent pacifist myself once in the Boer War when my own country was the aggressor and a young woman blew a squeaker at me on Mafeking Night  Tell us about Mafeking Night said Kay One gets sick of these discussions about right and wrong  Mafeking Night began the magician who was prepared to tell anybody about anything But the King prevented him  Tell us about Lot he said I want to know about him if I have to fight him Personally I am beginning to be interested in right and wrong  King Lot began Merlyn in the same tone of voice only to be interrupted by Kay  No said Kay Talk about the Queen She sounds more interesting  Queen Morgause  Arthur assumed the right of veto for the first time in his life Merlyn catching the lifted eyebrow reverted to the King of Orkney with unexpected humility  King Lot said he is simply a member of your peerage and landed royalty Hes a cipher You dont have to think about him at all  Why not  In the first place he is what we used to call in my young days a Gentleman of the Ascendancy His subjects are Gaels and so is his wife but he himself is an import from Norway He is a Gall like yourself a member of the ruling class who conquered the Islands long ago This means that his attitude to the war is the same as your fathers would have been He doesnt care a fig about Gaels or Galls but he goes in for wars in the same way as my Victorian friends used to go in for foxhunting or else for profit in ransoms Besides his wife makes him  Sometimes said the King I wish you had been born forwards like other people What with Victorians and Mafeking Night     Merlyn was indignant  The link between Norman warfare and Victorian foxhunting is perfect Leave your father and King Lot outside the question for the moment and look at literature Look at the Norman myths about legendary figures like the Angevin kings From William the Conqueror to Henry the Third they indulged in warfare seasonally The season came round and off they went to the meet in splendid armour which reduced the risk of injury to a foxhunters minimum Look at the decisive battle of Brenneville in which a field of nine hundred knights took part and only three were killed Look at Henry the Second borrowing money from Stephen to pay his own troops in fighting Stephen Look at the sporting etiquette according to which Henry had to withdraw from a siege as soon as his enemy Louis joined the defenders inside the town because Louis was his feudal overlord Look at the siege of Mont St Michel at which it was considered unsporting to win through the defenders lack of water Look at the battle of Malmesbury which was given up on account of bad weather That is the inheritance to which you have succeeded Arthur You have become the king of a domain in which the popular agitators hate each other for racial reasons while the nobility fight each other for fun and neither the racial maniac nor the overlord stops to consider the lot of the common soldier who is the one person that gets hurt Unless you can make the world wag better than it does at present King your reign will be an endless series of petty battles in which the aggressions will either be from spiteful reasons or from sporting ones and in which the poor man will be the only one who dies That is why I have been asking you to think That is why___  I think said Kay that Dinadan is waving to us to say that dinner is ready  5 Mother Marians house in the Out Isles was hardly bigger than a large dog kennel  but it was comfortable and full of interesting things There were two horseshoes nailed on the door  five statues bought from pilgrims with the used up rosaries wound round them  for beads break if one is a good prayer  several bunches of fairy flax laid on top of the salt  box  some scapulars wound round the poker  twenty bottles of mountain dew all empty but one  about a bushel of withered palm relic of Palm Sundays for the past seventy years  and plenty of woollen thread for tying round the cows tail when she was calving There was also a large scythe blade which the old lady hoped to use on a burglar  if ever one was foolish enough to come that way  and in the chimney there were hung some ash rungs which her deceased husband had been intending to use for flails together with eel skins and strips of horse leather as hangings to them Under the eel skins was an enormous bottle of holy water and in front of the turf fire sat one of the Irish Saints who lived in the beehive cells of the outer islands with a glass of water of life in his hand He was a relapsed saint who had fallen into the Pelagian heresy of Celestius and he believed that the soul was capable of its own salvation He was busy saving it with Mother Morlan and the usquebaugh  God and Mary to you Mother Morlan said Gawaine We have come for a story maam about the shee  God and Mary and Andrew to you exclaimed the beldame And you asking me for a story whateffer with his reverence here among the ashes  Good evening St Toirdealbhach we did not notice you because of the dark  The blessing of God to you  The same blessing to you yourself  It must be about murders said Agravaine About murders and some corbies which peck out your eyes  No no cried Gareth It must be about a mysterious girl who marries a man because he has stolen the giants magic horse  Glory be to God remarked St Toirdealbhach It does be a strange story yer after wanting entirely  Come now St Toirdealbhach tell us one yourself  Tell us about Ireland  Tell us about Queen Maeve who desired the bull  Or dance us one of the jigs  Maircy on the puir bairns to think of his holiness dancing a jig  The four representatives of the upper classes sat down wherever they could  there were only two stools  and stared at the holy man in receptive silence  Is it a moral tale yer after  No no No morals We like a story about fighting Come St Toirdealbhach what about the time you broke the Bishops head  The saint drank a big gulp of his white whisky and spat in the fire  There was a king in it one tune said he and the whole audience made a rustling noise with their rumps as they settled down  There was a king in it one time said St Toirdealbhach and this king what do you think was called King Conor Mac Nessa He was a whale of a man who lived with his relations at a place called Tara of the Kings It was not long before this king had to go out to battle against thim bloody OHaras and he got shot in the conflict with a magic ball You are to understand that the ancient heroes were after making thelmselves bullets out of the brains of their adversaries  which they would roll between the palms of their hands in little pieces and leave them to dry in the sun I suppose they must have shot them out of the arquebus you know as if they were sling shot or bolts Well and if they did this old King was shot in the temples with one of thim same bullets and it lodging against the bone of the skull at the critical point whatever Im a fine man now says the King and he sends for the brehons and those to advise with them about the obstetrics The first brehon says Youre a dead man King Conor This ball is at the lobe of the brain So said all the medical gintlemen widout respect of person nor creed Oh whatll I do at all cries the King of Ireland Its a hard fortune evidently when a man cant be fighting a little bit unless he comes to the end of his days None of yer prate now say the surgeons theres wan thing which can be done and that same thing is to keep from all unnatural excitement from this time forward For that matter says they ye must keep from all natural excitement also or otherwise the bullet will cause a rupture and the rupture rising to a flux and the flux to a conflammation will occasion an absolute abruption in the vital functions at all Its yer only hope King Conor or otherwise ye will lie compunctually as the worms made ye Well begor it was a fine state of business as you may imagine There was that poor Conor in his castle and he not able to laugh nor fight nor take any small sup of spirited water nor to look upon a white colleen anyhow for fear that his brains would burst The ball stood in his temples half in half out and that was the sorrow with him from that day forward  Wurra the doctors said Mother Morlan Hoots but theyre na canny  What happened him asked Gawaine Did he live long in this dark room  What happened him I was now coming to that Wan day there was a slashing thunderstorm in it and the castle walls shook like a long net and great part of the bailey fell upon them It was the worst storm that was known in those parts for whiles and King Conor rushed out into the element to seek advice He found wan of his brehons standing there whatever and axed him what could it be This brehon was a learned man and he told King Conor He said how our Saviour had been hanged on a tree in Jewry that day and how the storm was broken on  account of it and he spoke to King Conor about the gospel of God Then what do you think King Conor of Ireland ran back into his palace for to seek his sword in righteous passion and he ran out with it throughout the tempest to defend his Saviour   and that was how he died  He was dead  Yes  Well  What a nice way to do it said Gareth It was no good to him but it was grand  Agravaine said If I was told by my doctors to be careful I would not lose my temper over nothing I should think what was happening whatever  But it was chivalrous  Gawaine began to fidget with his toes  It was silly he said eventually It did no good  But he was trying to do the good  It was not for his family said Gawaine I do not know why he was so excited at all  Of course it was for his family It was for God who is the family of every person King Conor went out on the side of right and gave his life to help it  Agravaine moved his stern in the soft rusty ashes of the turf impatiently He considered that Gareth was a fool  Tell us the story he said to change the subject about how pigs were made  Or the one said Gawaine about the great Conan who was enchanted to a chair He was stuck on it whatever and they could not get him off So they pulled him from it by force and then there was a necessity on them to graft a piece of skin on his bottom  but it was sheepskin and from thenceforth the stockings worn by the Fianna were made from the wool which grew on Conan  No do not said Gareth Let there be no stories Let us sit and talk wisely my heroes on deep matters Let us talk about our father who is away to the wars  St Toirdealbhach took a deep draught of his mountain dew and spat in the fire  Isnt war the grand thing he observed reminiscently I did be going to wars a great deal wan time before I was sainted Only I got tired on them  Gawaine said: I cannot see how people ever get tired of wars I am sure I will not After all it is a gentlemans occupation I mean it would be like getting tired of hunting or of hawks  War said Toirdealbhach bes a good thing if there doesnt be too many in it When theres too many fighting how would you know what you are fighting about at all There did be fine wars in Old Ireland but it would be about a bull or something and every man had his heart in it from the start  Why did you get tired of wars   Twas thim same numbers had thim destroyed altogether Who would want to be killing a mortal for what he didnt understand or for nothing I took up with the single combats instead  That must have been a long time ago  Aye said the saint regretfully Thim bullets I was telling ye about now: the brains didnt be much good widout they were taken in single combat It was the virtue of them  I incline my agreement with Toirdealbhach said Gareth After all what is the good of killing poor kerns who do not know anything It would be much better for the people who are angry to fight each other thelmselves knight against knight  But you could not have any wars at all like that exclaimed Gaheris  It would be absurd said Gawaine You must have people galore of people in a war  Otherwise you could not kill them explained Agravaine  The saint helped himself to a fresh dose of whisky hummed a few bars of Poteen Good Luck to Ye Dear and glanced at Mother Morlan He was feeling a new heresy coming over him possibly as a result of the spirits and it had something to do with the celibacy of the clergy He had one already about the shape of his tonsure and the usual one about the date of Easter as well as his own Pelagian business  but the latest was beginning to make him feel as if the presence of children was unnecessary  Wars he said with disgust And how would kids like you be talking about them will ye tell me and you no bigger than sitting hens Be off now before I beget an ill wish toward ye  Saints as the Old Ones knew very well were a bad class of people to cross so the children stood up hastily  Och now they said Your Holiness no offence we are sure We were only at wishing to make an exchange of ideas  Ideas he exclaimed reaching for the poker  and they were outside the low door in the twinkling of an eye standing in the level rays of sunset on the sandy street while his anathemas or whatever they may have been rumbled behind them from the dark interior  In the street there were two moth eaten donkeys searching for weeds in the cracks of a stone wall Their legs were tied together so that they could hardly hobble and their hoofs were cruelly overgrown so that they looked like rams horns or curly skates The boys  commandeered them at once a new idea springing fully armed from their heads as soon as they had seen the animals They would stop hearing stories or discussing warfare and they would take the donkeys to the little harbour beyond the sand dunes in case the men who had been out in their currachs should have made a catch The donkeys would be useful for carrying the fish  Gawaine and Gareth took turns with the fat ass one of them whacking it while the other rode bareback The ass gave a hop occasionally but refused to trot Agravaine and Gaheris both sat on the thin one the former being mounted back to front so that he faced the creatures behind  which he thrashed furiously with a thick root of sea weed He beat it round the vent to hurt it more  It was a strange scene which they presented when they reached the sea  the thin children whose sharp noses had a drop on the end of each and their bony wrists which had outgrown their coats  the donkeys scampering round in small circles with an occasional frisk as the tangle bit into their grey quarters It was strange because it was circumscribed because it was concentrated on a single intention They might have been a solar system of their own with nothing else in space as they went round and round among the dunes and coarse grass of the estuary Probably the planets have few ideas in their heads either  The idea which the children had was to hurt the donkeys Nobody had told them that it was cruel to hurt them but then nobody had told the donkeys either On the rim of the world they knew too much about cruelty to be surprised by it So the small circus was a unity  the beasts reluctant to move and the children vigorous to move them the two parties bound together by the link of pain to which they both agreed without question The pain itself was so much a matter of course that it had vanished out of the picture as if by a process of cancellation The animals did not seem to be suffering and the children did not seem to be enjoying the suffering The only difference was that the boys were violently animated while the donkeys were as static as possible  Into this Eden like scene and almost before the memory of Mother Morlans interior had faded from their minds there came a magic barge from over the water a barge draped with white samite mystic wonderful and it made a music of its own accord as its keel passed through the waves Inside it there were three knights and a seasick brachet Anything less suitable than these to the tradition of the Gaelic world it would have been impossible to imagine  I say said the voice of one of the knights in the barge while they were still far out there is a castle isnt it what I say isnt it a pretty one  Stop joggin the boat my dear fellow said the second or you will have us in the sea  King Pellinores enthusiasm evaporated at the rebuke and he startled the petrified children by bursting into tears They could hear his sobs mingling with the lapping of the waves and with the music of the boat as it drew near  Oh sea he said I wish I was in you what I wish I was full of five fathoms that I do Woe woe oh woe  It is no good saying Whoa old boy The thing will whoa when it wants to It is a magic un  I was not saying Whoa retorted the King I was saying Woe  Well it wont whoa  I dont care if it does or if it dont I said Woe  Well whoa then  And the magic barge whoaed just where the currachs were usually drawn up The three knights got out and it could be seen that the third was a black man He was a learned paynim or saracen called Sir Palomides  Happy landing said Sir Palomides by golly  The people came from everywhere silently vaguely When they were near the knights they walked slowly but in the remoter distance they were running Men women and children were scuttling over the dunes or down from the castle cliff only to break into the crawling pace as soon as they were near At a distance of twenty yards they halted altogether They made a ring staring at the newcomers mutely like people staring at pictures in the Uffizzi They studied them There was no hurry now no need to dash off to the next picture Indeed there were no other pictures  had been no others except for the accustomed scenes of Lothian since they were born Their stare was not exactly an offensive one nor was it friendly Pictures exist to be absorbed It began at the feet especially as the strangers were dressed in outlandish clothes like knights in armour and it mastered the texture the construction the articulation and the probable price of their sabathons Then it went on to the greaves the cuisses and so up It might take half an hour to reach the face which was to be examined last of all  The Gaels stood round the Galls with their mouths open while the village children shouted the news in the distance and Mother Morlan came jogging with her skirts tucked up and the currachs at sea came rowing madly home The young princelings of Lothian got off their donkeys as if in a trance and joined the circle The circle itself began to press inward on its focus moving as slowly and as silently as the minute hand of a clock except for the suppressed shouts from the late arrivals who fell silent thelmselves as soon as they were within the influence The circle was contracting because it wanted to touch the knights  not now not for half an hour or so not until the examination was over perhaps never But it would have liked to touch them in the end partly to be sure that they were real partly to sum up the price of their clothes And as the pricing was continued three things began to happen Mother Morlan and the auld wives started to say the rosary while the young women pinched each other and giggled  the men having doffed their caps in deference to the praying began to exchange in Gaelic such remarks as Look at the black man God between us and harm or Do they be naked at bedtime or how do they get the iron pots off them whatever   and in the minds of both women and men irrespective of age or circumstance there began to grow almost visibly almost tangibly the enormous the incalculable miasma which is the leading feature of the Gaelic brain  These were Knights of the Sassenach they were thinking  for they could tell by the armour  and if so knights of that very King Arthur against whom their own king had for the second time revolted Had they come with typical Sassenach cunning so as to take King Lot in the rear Had they come as representatives of the feudal overlord  the Landlord  so as to  make an assessment for the next scutage Were they Fifth Columnists More complicated even than this  for surely no Sassenach could be so simple as to come in the garb of the Sassenach  were they perhaps not representatives of King Arthur at all Were they for some purpose almost too cunning for belief only disguised as thelmselves Where was the catch There always was one in everything  The people of the circle closed in their jaws dropping even further their crooked bodies hunching into the shapes of sacks and scarecrows their small eyes glinting in every direction with unfathomable subtlety their faces assuming an expression of dogged stupidity even more vacant than they actually were  The knights drew closer for protection In point of fact they did not know that England was at war with Orkney They had been involved in a Quest which had kept them away from the latest news Nobody in Orkney was likely to tell them  Dont look just now said King Pellinore but there are some people Do you think they are all right  6 In Carlion everything was at sixes and sevens in preparation for the second campaign Merlyn had made suggestions about the way to win it but as these involved an ambush with secret aid from abroad they had had to be kept dark Lots slowly approaching army was so much more numerous than the Kings forces that it had been necessary to resort to stratagems The way in which the battle was to be fought was a secret only known to four people The common citizens who were in ignorance of the higher policy had a great deal to do There were pikes to be ground to a fine edge so that the grindstones in the town were roaring day and night  there were thousands of arrows to be dressed so that there were lights in the fletchers houses at all hours  and the unfortunate geese on the commons were continually being chased by excited yeomen who wanted feathers The royal peacocks were as bare as an old broom  most of the crack shots liked to have what Chaucer calls pecock arwes because they were more classy  and the smell of boiling glue rose to high heaven The armourers accomplishing the knights hammered away with musical clinks working double shirts at it and the blacksmiths shod the chargers and the nuns never stopped knitting comforters for the soldiers or making the kind of bandages which were called tents King Lot had already named a rendezvous for the battle at Bedegraine  The King of England painfully climbed the two hundred and eight steps which led to Merlyns tower room and knocked on the door The magician was inside with Archimedes sitting on the back of his chair busily trying to find the square root of minus one He had forgotten how to do it  Merlyn said the King panting I want to talk to you  He closed his book with a bang leaped to his feet seized his wand of lignum vitae and rushed at Arthur as if he were trying to shoo away a stray chicken  Go away he shouted What are you doing here What do you mean by it Arent you the King of England Go away and send for me Get out of my room I never heard of such a thing Go away at once and send for me  But I am here  No youre not retorted the old man resourcefully And he pushed the King out of the door slamming it in his face  Well said Arthur and he went off sadly down the two hundred and eight stairs  An hour later Merlyn presented himself in the Royal Chamber in answer to a summons which had been delivered by a page  Thats better he said and sat down comfortably on a carpet chest  Stand up said Arthur and he clapped his hands for a page to take away the seat  Merlyn stood up boiling with indignation The whites of his knuckles blanched as he clenched them  About our conversation on the subject of chivalry began the King in an airy tone  I dont recollect such a conversation No  I have never been so insulted in my life But I am the King said Arthur You cant sit down in front of the King Rubbish  Arthur began to laugh more than was seemly and his foster brother Sir Kay and his old guardian Sir Ector came out from behind the throne where they had been hiding Kay took off Merlyns hat and put it on Sir Ector and Sir Ector said Well bless my soul now I am a nigromancer Hocus Pocus Then everybody began laughing including Merlyn eventually and seats were sent for so that they could sit down and bottles of wine were opened so that it should not be a dry meeting  You see he said proudly I have summoned a council  There was a pause for it was the first time that Arthur had made a speech and he wanted to collect his wits for it Well said the King It is about chivalry I want to ialk about that  Merlyn was immediately watching him with a sharp eye His knobbed fingers fluttered among the stars and secret signs of his gown but he would not help the speaker You might say that this moment was the critical one in his career  the moment towards which he had been living backward for heaven knows how many centuries and now he was to see for certain whether he had lived in vain  I have been thinking said Arthur about Might and Right I dont think things ought to be done because you are able to do them I think they should be done because you ought to do them After all a penny is a penny in any case however much Might is exerted on either side to prove that it is or is not Is that plain Nobody answered  Well I was talking to Merlyn on the battlements one day and he mentioned that the last battle we had  in which seven hundred kerns were killed  was not so much fun as I had thought it was Of course battles are not fun when you come to think about them I mean people ought not to be killed ought they It is better to be alive Very well But the funny thing is that Merlyn was helping me to win battles He is still helping me for that matter and we hope to win the battle of Bedegraine together when it comes off  We will said Sir Ector who was in the secret  That seems to me to be inconsistent Why does he help me to fight wars if they are bad things  There was no answer from anybody and the King began to speak with agitation  I could only think said he beginning to blush I could only think that I  that we  that he  that he wanted me to win them for a reason  He paused and looked at Merlyn who turned his head away  The reason was  was it  the reason was that if I could be the master of my kingdom by winning these two battles I could stop them afterwards and then do something about the business of Might Have I guessed Was I right  The magician did not turn his head and his hands lay still in his lap  I was exclaimed Arthur  And he began talking so quickly that he could hardly keep up with himself  You see he said Might is not Right But there is a lot of Might knocking about in this world and something has to be done about it It is as if People were half horrible and half nice Perhaps they are even more than half horrible and when they are left to thelmselves they run wild You get the average baron that we see nowadays people like Sir Bruce Sans Piti� who simply go clod hopping round the country dressed in steel and doing exactly what they please for sport It is our Norman idea about the upper classes having a monopoly of power without reference to justice Then the horrible side gets uppermost and there is thieving and rape and plunder and torture The people become beasts  But you see Merlyn is helping me to win my two battles so that I can stop this He wants me to put things right  Lot and Uriens and Anguish and those  they are the old world the old fashioned order who want to have their private will I have got to vanquish them with their own weapons  they force it upon me because they live by force  and then the real work will begin This battle at Bedegraine is the preliminary you see It is after the battle that Merlyn is wanting me to think about  Arthur paused again for comment or encouragement but the magicians face was turned away It was only Sir Ector sitting next to him who could see his eyes  Now what I have thought said Arthur is this Why cant you harness Might so that it works for Right I know it sounds nonsense but I mean you cant just say there is no such thing the Might is there in the bad half of people and you cant neglect it You cant cut it out but you might be able to direct it if you see what I mean so that it was uuseful instead of bad  The audience was interested They leaned forward to listen except Merlyn  My idea is that if we can win this battle in front of us and get a firm hold of the country then I will institute a sort of order of chivalry I will not punish the bad knights or hang Lot but I will try to get them into our Order We shall have to make it a great honour you see and make it fashionable and all that Everybody must wan to be in And then I shall make the oath of the order that Might is only to be used for Right So you follow The knights in my order will ride all over the world still dresed in steel and whacking away with their swords   that will give an outlet for wanting to whack you understand an outlet for what Merlyn calls the foxhunting spirit  but they will be bound to strike only on behalf of what is good to defend virgins against Sir Bruce and to restor what has been done wrotn in the past and to help the oppressed and so forth Do you see the idea It will be using the Might instead of fighting against it and tu4rning a bad thing into a good There Merlyn that is all I can think of I have thought as hard as I could and I suppose I am wrong as usual But I did think I cant do any better Please say something  The magician stood up as striaght as a pillar stretched out his arms in both directions looked at the ceiling and said the first few words of the Nunc Dimittis  7 The situation at Dunlothian was complicated Nearly every situation tended to be when it was connected with King Pellinore even in the wildest North In the first place hwe was in love  that was why he had been weeping in the boat He explained it to Queen Morgause on the first opportunity  because he was lovesick not seasick  What had happened was this The King had been hunting the Questing Beast a few months earlier on the south coast of Gramarye when the animal had taken to the sea She had swam away her serpentine head undulating on the surface like a swimming grass snake and the King had hailed a passing ship which looked as if it were off to the Crusades Sir Grummore and Sir Palomides had been in the ship and they had kindly turned it round to pursue the Beast The three of them had arrived on the coast of Flanders where the Beast had disappeared in a forest and there while they were staying at a hospitable castel Pellinore had fallen in love with the Queen of Flanders daughter This was fine so far as it went  for the lady of his choice was a managing middle aged stout hearted creature who could cook ride a straight line and make beds  but the hopes of all parties had been dashed at the start by the arrival of the magic barge The three knights had got into it and sat down to see what would happen because knights were never supposed to refuse an adventure But the barge had promptly sailed away of its own accord leaving the Queen of Flanders daughter anxiously waving her pocket handkerchief The Questing Beast had thrust her head ot of the forest before they lost sight of land looking so far as they could see at the distance even more surprised than the lady After that they had gone on sailing till they arrived in the Out Isles and the further they went the more lovesick the King had become which made his company  intolerable He spent the time writing poems and letters which could never be posted or telling his companions about the princess whose nickname in her family circle was Piggy  A state of affairs like this might have been bearable in England where people like the Pellinores did sometimes turn up and even won a sort of tolerance from their fellow men But in Lothian and Orkney where Englishmen were tyrants it achieved an almost supernatural impossibility None of the islanders could understand what King Pellinore was trying to cheat them out of  by pretending to be himself  and it was thought wiser and safer not to acquaint any of the visiting knights with the facts about the war against Arthur It was better to wait until their plots had been penetrated  On top of this there was a trouble which distressed the children in particular Queen Morgause had set her cap at the visitors  What was our mother at doing asked Gawaine as they made their way toward St Toirdealbhachs cell one morning with the knights on the mountain  Gaheris answered with some difficulty after a long pause: They were at hunting a unicorn How do you do that There must be a virgin to attract it Our mother said Agravaine who also knew the details went on a unicorn hunt and she was the virgin for them His voice sounded strange as he made this announcement Gareth protested: I did not know she was wanting a unicorn She has never said so  Agravaine looked at him sideways cleared his throat and quoted: Half a word is sufficient to the wise man How do you know this asked Gawaine We listened  They had a way of listening on the spiral stairs during the times when they were excluded from their mothers interest  Gaheris explained with unusual freedom since he was a taciturn boy:  She told Sir Grummore that this Kings lovesick melancholy could be dispelled by interesting him in his old pursuits They were at saying that this King is in the habit of hunting a Beast which has become lost So she said that they were to hunt a unicorn instead and she would be the virgin for them They were surprised I think  They walked in silence until Gawaine suggested almost as if it were a question: I was hearing it told that the King is in love with a woman out of Flanders and that Sir Grummore is married already Also the Saracen is black in his skin  No answer  It was a long hunt said Gareth I heard they did not catch one  Do these knights enjoy to be playing this game with our mother  Gaheris explained for the second tune Even if he were silent he was not unobservant  I do not think they would be understanding at all  They plodded on reluctant to disclose their thoughts  St Toirdealbhachs cell was like an old fashioned straw beehive except that it was bigger and made of stone It had no windows and only one door through which you had to crawl  Your Holiness they shouted when they got there kicking the heavy unmortared stones Your Holiness we have come to hear a story  He was a source of mental nourishment to them  a sort of guru as Merlyn had been to Arthur who gave them what little culture they were ever to get They resorted to him like hungry puppies anxious for any kind of eatable when their mother had cast them out He had taught them to read and write  Ah now said the saint sticking his head out of the door The prosperity of God on you this morning  The selfsame prosperity on you  Is there any news at you  There is not said Gawaine suppressing the unicorn  St Toirdealbhach heaved a deep sigh  There is none at me either he said  Could you tell us a story  Thim stories now There doesnt be any good in them What would I be wanting to tell you a story for and me in my heresies Tis forty years since I fought a natural battle and not a one of me looking upon a white colleen all that time  so how would I be telling stories  You could tell us a story without any colleens or battles in it  And what would be the good of that now he exclaimed indignantly coming out into the sunlight  If you were to fight a battle said Gawaine but he left out about the colleens you might feel better  My sorrow cried Toirdealbhach What do I want to be a saint for at all is my puzzle If I could fetch one crack at somebody with me ould shillelagh  here he produced a frightful  looking weapon from under his gown  wouldnt it be better than all the saints in Ireland  Tell us about the shillelagh  They examined the club carefully while his holiness told them how a good one should be made He told them that only a root growth was any good as common branches were apt to break especially if they were of crab tree and how to smear the club with lard and wrap it up and bury it in a dunghill while it was being straightened and polish it with black lead and  grease He showed the hole where the lead was poured in and the nails through the end and the notches near the handle which stood for ancient scalps Then he kissed it reverently and replaced it under his gown with a heartfelt sigh He was play acting and putting on the accent  Tell us the story about the black arm which came down the chimney  Ah the heart isnt in me said the saint I havent the heart of a hare Its bewitched I am entirely  I think we are bewitched too said Gareth Everything seems to go wrong  There was this one in it began Toirdealbhach and she was a woman There was a husband living in Malainn Vig with this woman There was only one little girl that they had between them One day the man went out to cut in the bog and when it was the time for his dinner this woman sent the little girl out with his bit of dinner When the father was sitting to his dinner the little girl suddenly made a cry Look now father do you see the large ship out yonder under the horizon I could make it come in to the shore beneath the coast You could not do that said the father I am bigger than you are and I could not do it myself Well look at me now said the little girl And she went to the well that was near there and made a stirring in the water The ship came in at the coast  She was a witch explained Gaheris  It was the mother was the witch said the saint and continued with his story   Now says she I could make the ship be struck against the coast You could not do that says the father Well look at me now says the little girl and she jumped into the well The ship was dashed against the coast and broken into a thousand pieces Who has taught you to do these things asked the father My mother And when you do be at working she teaches me to do things with the Tub at home  Why did she jump into the well asked Agravaine Was she wet Hush  When this man got home to his wife he set down his turf cutter and put himself in his sitting Then he said What have you been teaching to the little girl I do not like to have this piseog in my house and I will not stay with you any longer So he went away and they never saw a one of him again I do not know how they went on after that It must be dreadful to have a witch for a mother said Gareth when he had finished Or for a wife said Gawaine  Its worse not to be having a wife at all said the saint and he vanished into his beehive with startling suddenness like the man in the Swiss weather clock who retires into a hole when it is going to be fine  The boys sat round the door without surprise waiting for something else to happen They considered in their minds the questions of wells witches unicorns and the practices of mothers  I make this proposition said Gareth unexpectedly my heroes that we have a unicorn hunt of our own They looked at him  It would be better than not having anything We have not seen our Mammy for one week  She has forgotten us said Agravaine bitterly She has not so You are not to speak in that way of our mother  It is true We have not been to serve at dinner even It is because she has a necessity to be hospitable to these knights No it is not What is it then I will not say  If we could do a unicorn hunt said Gareth and bring this unicorn which she requires perhaps we would be allowed to serve They considered the idea with a beginning of hope  St Toirdealbhach they shouted come out again We want to catch a unicorn  The saint put his head out of the hole and examined them suspiciously  What is a unicorn What are they like How do you catch them  He nodded the head solemnly and vanished for the second time to return on all fours in a few moments with a learned volume the only secular work in his possession Like most saints he made his living by copying manuscripts and drawing pictures for them  You need a maid for bait they told him  We have goleor of maids said Gareth We could take any of the maids or cook  They would not come  We could take the kitchenmaid We could make her to come  And then when we have caught the unicorn which is wanted we will bring it home in triumph and give it to our mother We will serve at supper every night  She will be pleased  Perhaps after supper whatever the event  And Sir Grummore will knight us He will say Never has such a doughty deed been done by my halidome  St Toirdealbhach laid the precious book on the grass outside his hole The grass was sandy and had empty snail shells scattered over it small yellowish shells with a purple spiral He opened the book which was a Bestiary called Liber de Natura Quorundam Animalium and showed that it had pictures on every page  They made him turn the vellum quickly with its lovely Gothic manuscript skipping the enchanting Griffins Bonnacons Cocodrills Manticores Chaladrii Cinomulgi Sirens Peridexions Dragons and Aspidochelones In vain for their eager glances did the Antalop  rub its complicated horns against the tamarisk tree  thus entangled becoming a prey to its hunters  in vain did the Bonnacon emit its flatulence in order to baffle the pursuers The Peridexions sitting on trees which made them immune to dragons sat unnoticed The Panther blew out his fragrant breath which attracted his prey without interest for them The Tigris who could be deceived by throwing down a glass ball at its feet in which seeing itself reflected it thought to see its own cubs  the Lion who spared prostrate men or captives was afraid of white cocks and brushed out his own tracks with a foliated tail  the Ibex who could bound down from mountains unharmed because he bounced upon his curly horns  the Yale who could move his horns like ears  the She Bear who was accustomed to bear her young as lumps of matter and lick them into whatever shape she fancied afterwards  the Chaladrius bird who if facing you when it sat on your bedrail showed that you were going to die   the Hedgehop who collected grapes for their progeny by rolling on them and brought them back on the end of their prickles  even the Aspidochelone who was a large whale like creature with seven fins and a sheepish expression to whom you were liable to moor your boat in mistake for an island if you were not careful: even the Aspidochelone scarcely detained them At last he found them the place at the Unicorn called by the Greeks Rhinoceros  It seemed that the Unicorn was as swift and timid as the Antalop and could only be captured in one way You had to have a maid for bait and when the Unicorn perceived her alone he would immediately come to lay his horn in her lap There was a picture of an unreliable  looking virgin holding the poor creatures horn in one hand while she beckoned to some spearmen with the other Her expression of duplicity was balanced by the fatuous confidence with which the Unicorn regarded her  Gawaine hurried off as soon as the instructions had been read and the picture digested to fetch the kitchenmaid without delay  Now then he said you have to come with us on the mountain to catch a unicorn  Oh Master Gawaine cried the maid he had caught hold of whose name was Meg  Yes you have You are to be the bait whatever It will come and put its head in your lap  Meg began to weep  Now then do not be silly  Oh Master Gawaine I do not want a unicorn I have been a decent girl I have and there is all the washing up to do and if Mistress Truelove do catch me playing at truant I shall get stick Master Gawaine that I will  He took her firmly by the plaits and led her out  In the clean bog wind of the high tops they discussed the hunt Meg who cried incessantly was held by the hair to prevent her from running away and occasionally passed from one boy to the other if the one who was holding her happened to want both hands for gestures  Now then said Gawaine I am the captain I am the oldest so I am the captain  I thought of it said Gareth  The question is it says in the book that the bait must be left alone  She will run away  Will you run away Meg  Yes please Master Gawaine  There  Then she must be tied  Oh Master Gaheris if it is your will need I be tied  Close your mouth You are only a girl  There is nothing to tie her with  I am the captain my heroes and I command that Gareth runs back home to fetch some rope  That I will not  But you will destroy everything if you do not do so  I do not see why I should have to go I thought of it  Then I command our Agravaine to go  Not I  Let Gaheris go  I will not  Meg you wicked girl you are not to run away do you hear  Yes Master Gawaine But oh Master Gawaine     If we could find a strong heather root said Agravaine we could tie her pigtails together round the other side of it  We will do that  Oh oh  After they had secured the virgin the four boys stood round her discussing the next stage They had abstracted real boar spears from the armoury so they were properly armed  This girl said Agravaine is my mother This is what our Mammy was at doing yesterday And I am going to be Sir Grummore  I will be Pellinore  Agravaine can be Grummore if he wants to be but the bait has got to be left alone It says so in the book  Oh Master Gawaine oh Master Agravaine  Stop howling You will frighten the unicorn  And then we must go away and hide That is why our mother did not catch it because the knights stayed with her  I am going to be Finn MacCoul  I shall be Sir Palomides  Oh Master Gawaine pray do not leave me alone  Hold in your noise said Gawaine You are silly You ought to be proud to be the bait Our mother was yesterday  Gareth said Never mind Meg do not cry We will not let it hurt you  After all it can only kill you said Agravaine brutally  At this the unfortunate girl began to weep more than ever  Why did you say that asked Gawaine angrily You always try to frighten people Now she is at howling more than before  Look said Gareth Look Meg Poor Meg do not cry It will be with me to let you have some shots with my catapult when we go home  Oh Master Gareth  Ach come your ways We cannot bother with her  There there  Oh oh  Meg said Gawaine making a frightful face if you do not stop squealing I will look at you like this  She dried her tears at once  Now he said when the unicorn comes we must all rush out and stick it Do you understand  Must it be killed  Yes it must be killed dead  I see  I hope it will not hurt it said Gareth  That is the sort of foolish hope you would have said Agravaine  But I do not see why it should be killed  So that we may take it home to our mother you amadan  Could we catch it asked Gareth and lead it to our mother do you think I mean we could get Meg to lead it if it was tame  Gawaine and Gaheris agreed to this  If it is tame they said it would be better to bring it back alive That is the best kind of Big Game Hunting  We could drive it said Agravaine We could hit it along with sticks  We could hit Meg too he added as an afterthought  Then they hid thelmselves in their ambush and decided to keep silence There was nothing to be heard except the gentle wind the heather bees the skylarks very high and a few distant snuffles from Meg  When the unicorn came things were different from what had been expected He was such a noble animal to begin with that he carried a beauty with him It held all spellbound who were within sight  The unicorn was white with hoofs of silver and a graceful horn of pearl He stepped daintily over the heather scarcely seeming to press it with his airy trot and the wind made waves in his long mane which had been freshly combed The glorious thing about him was his eyes There was a faint bluish furrow down each side of his nose and this led up to the eye sockets and surrounded them in a pensive shade The eyes circled by this sad and beautiful darkness were so sorrowful lonely gentle and nobly tragic that they killed all other emotion except love  The unicorn went up to Meg the kitchenmaid and bowed his head in front of her He arched his neck beautifully to do this and the pearl horn pointed to the ground at her feet and he scratched in the heather with his silver hoof to make a salute Meg had forgotten her tears She made a royal gesture of acknowledgment and held her hand out to the animal  Come unicorn she said Lay your head in my lap if you like  The unicorn made a whinny and pawed again with his hoof Then very carefully he went down first on one knee and then on the other till he was bowing in front of her He looked up at her from this position with his melting eyes and at last laid his head upon her knee He stroked his flat white cheek against the smoothness of her dress looking at her beseechingly The whites of his eyes rolled with an upward flash He settled his hind quarters coyly and lay still looking up His eyes brimmed with trustfulness and he lifted his near fore in a gesture of pawing It was a movement in the air only which said Now attend to me Give me some love Stroke my mane will you please  There was a choking noise from Agravaine in the ambush and at once he was rushing toward the unicorn with the sharp boar spear in his hands The other boys squatted upright on their heels watching him  Agravaine came to the unicorn and began jabbing his spear into its quarters into its slim belly into its ribs He squealed as he jabbed and the unicorn looked to Meg in anguish It leaped and moved suddenly still looking at her reproachfully and Meg took its horn in one hand She seemed entranced unable to help it The unicorn did not seem able to move from the soft grip of her hand on its horn The blood caused by Agravaines spear spurted out upon the blue white coat of hair  Gareth began running with Gawaine close after him Gaheris came last stupid and not knowing what to do  Dont cried Gareth Leave him alone Dont Dont  Gawaine came up just as Agravaines spear went in under the fifth rib The unicorn shuddered He trembled in all his body and stretched his hind legs out behind They went out almost straight as if he were doing his greatest leap  and then quivered trembling in the agony of death All the time his eyes were fixed on Megs eyes and she still looked down at his  What are you doing shouted Gawaine Leave him alone No harm at him  Oh Unicorn whispered Meg  The unicorns legs stretched out horizontally behind him and stopped trembling His head dropped in Megs lap After a last kick they became rigid and the blue lids rose half over the eye The creature lay still  What have you done cried Gareth You have killed him He was beautiful  Agravaine bawled This girl is my mother He put his head in her lap He had to die  We said we would keep him yelled Gawaine We said we would take him home and be allowed to supper  Poor unicorn said Meg  Look said Gaheris I am afraid he is dead  Gareth stood square in front of Agravaine who was three years older than he was and could have knocked him down quite easily Why did you do it he demanded You are a murderer It was a lovely unicorn Why did you kill it  His head was in our mothers lap  It did not mean any harm Its hoofs were silver  It was a unicorn and it had to be killed I ought to have killed Meg too  You are a traitor said Gawaine We could have taken it home and been allowed to serve at supper  Anyway said Gaheris now it is dead  Meg bowed her head over the unicorns forelock of white and once again began to sob  Gareth began stroking the head He had to turn away to hide his tears By stroking it he had found out how smooth and soft its coat was He had seen a near view of its eye now quickly fading and this had brought the tragedy home to him  Well it is dead now whatever said Gaheris for the third time We had better take it home  We managed to catch one said Gawaine the wonder of their achievement beginning to dawn on him  It was a brute said Agravaine  We caught it We of ourselves  Sir Grummore did not catch one  But we did  Gawaine had forgotten about his sorrow for the unicorn He began to dance round the body waving his boar spear and uttering horrible shrieks  We must have a gralloch said Gaheris We must do the matter properly and cut its insides out and sling it over a pony and take it home to the castle like proper hunters  And then she will be pleased  She will say Gods Feet but my sons are of mickle might  We shall be allowed to be like Sir Grummore and King Pellinore Everything will go well with us from now  How must we set about the gralloch  We cut out its guts said Agravaine  Gareth got up and began to go away into the heather He said I do not want to help cut him Do you Meg  Meg who was feeling ill inside herself made no answer Gareth untied her hair  and suddenly she was off running for all she was worth away from the tragedy toward the castle Gareth ran after her  Meg Meg he called Wait for me Do not run  But Meg continued to run as swiftly as an antalop with her bare feet twinkling behind her and Gareth gave it up He flung himself down in the heather and began to cry in earnest  he did not know why  At the gralloch the three remaining huntsmen were in trouble They had begun to slit at the skin of the belly but they did not know how to do it properly and so they had perforated the intestines Everything had begun to be horrible and the once beautiful animal was spoiled and repulsive All three of them loved the unicorn in their various ways Agravaine in the most twisted one and in proportion as they became responsible for spoiling its beauty so they began to hate it for their guilt Gawaine particularly began to hate the body He hated it for being dead for having been beautiful for making him feel a beast He had loved it and helped to trap it so now there was nothing to be done except to vent his shame and hatred of himself upon the corpse He hacked and cut and felt like crying too  We shall not ever get it done they panted How can we ever carry it down even if we manage the gralloch  But we must said Gaheris We must If we do not what will be the good We must take it home  We cannot carry it  We have not a pony  At a gralloch they sling the beast over a pony  We must cut his head off said Agravaine We must cut its head off somehow and carry that It would be enough if we took the head We could carry it between us  So they set to work hating their work at the horrid business of hacking through its neck  Gareth stopped crying in the heather He rolled over on his back and immediately he was looking straight into the sky The clouds which were sailing majestically across its endless depth made him feel giddy He thought: How far is it to that cloud A mile And the one above it Two miles And beyond that a mile and a mile and a million million miles all in the empty blue Perhaps I will fall off the earth now supposing the earth is upside down and  then I shall go sailing and sailing away I shall try to catch hold of the clouds as I pass them but they wul not stop me Where shall I go  This thought made Gareth feel sick and as he was also feeling ashamed of himself for running away from the gralloch he became uncomfortable all over In these circumstances the only thing to do was to abandon the place in which he was feeling uncomfortable in the hope of leaving his discomfort behind him He got up and went back to the others  Hallo said Gawaine did you catch her  No she escaped away to the castle  I hope she will not tell anybody said Gaheris It has to be a surprise or it is no good for us  The three butchers were daubed with sweat and blood and they were absolutely miserable Agravaine had been sick twice Yet they continued in their labour and Gareth helped them  It is no good stopping now said Gawaine Think how good it will be if we can take it to our mother  She will probably come upstairs to say good night to us if we can take her what she needs  She will laugh and say we are mighty hunters  When the grisly spine was severed the head was too heavy to carry They got thelmselves in a mess trying to lift it Then Gawaine suggested that it had better be dragged with rope There was none  We could drag it by the horn said Gareth At any rate we could drag and push it like that so long as it was downhill  Only one of them at a time could get a good hold of the horn so they took it in turns to do the hauling while the others pushed behind when the head got snagged in a heather root or a drain It was heavy for them even in this way so that they had to stop every twenty yards or so to change over  When we get to the castle panted Gawaine we will prop it up in the seat in the garden Our mother is bound to walk past there when she goes for her walk before supper Then we will stand in front of it until she is ready and all will suddenly step back at once and there it will be  She will be surprised said Gaheris  When they had at last got it down from the sloping ground there was another hitch They found that it was no longer possible to drag it on the flat land because the horn did not give enough purchase  In this emergency for it was getting near to suppertime Gareth voluntarily ran ahead to fetch a rope The rope was tied round what remained of the head and thus at last with eyes ruined  flesh bruised and separating from the bones the muddy bloody heather mangled exhibit was conveyed on its last stage to the herb garden They heaved it to the seat and arranged its mane as well as they could Gareth particularly tried to prop it up so that it would give a little idea of the beauty which he remembered  The magic queen came punctually on her walk conversing with Sir Grummore and followed by her lap dogs: Tray Blanche and Sweetheart She did not notice her four sons lined up in front of the seat They stood respectfully in a row dirty excited their breasts beating with hope  Now cried Gawaine and they stood aside  Queen Morgause did not see the unicorn Her mind was busy with other things With Sir Grummore she passed by  Mother cried Gareth in a strange voice and he ran after her plucking at her skirt  Yes my white one What do you want  Oh Mother We have got you a unicorn  How amusing they are Sir Grummore she said Well my doves you must run along and ask for your milk  But Mammy  Yes yes she said in a low voice Another time  And the Queen passed on with the puzzled knight of the Forest Sauvage electrical and quiet She had not noticed that her childrens clothes were ruined: had not even scolded them about that When she found out about the unicorn later in the evening she had them whipped for it for she had spent an unsuccessful day with the English knights  8 The plain of Bedegraine was a forest of pavilions They looked like old fashioned bathing tents and were every colour of the rainbow Some of them were even striped like bathing tents but the most part were in plain colours yellow and green and so on There were heraldic devices worked or stamped on the sides  enormous black eagles with two heads perhaps or wyverns or lances or oak trees or punning signs which referred to the names of the owners For instance Sir Kay had a black key on his tent and Sir Ulbawes in the opposing camp had a couple of elbows in flowing sleeves The proper name for them would be manchets Then there were pennons floating from the tops of the tents and sheaves of spears leaning against them The more sporting barons had shields or huge copper basins outside their front doors and all you had to do was to give a thump on one of these with the butt end of your spear for the baron to come out like an angry bee and have a fight with you almost before the resounding boom had died away Sir Dinadan who was a cheerful man had hung a chamber pot outside his Then there were the people thelmselves All round and about among the tents there were cooks quarrelling with dogs who had eaten the mutton and  small pages writing insults on each others backs when they were not looking and elegant minstrels with lutes singing tunes similar to Greensleeves with soulful expressions and squires with a world of innocence in their eyes trying to sell each other spavined horses and hurdy gurdy men trying to earn a groat by playing on the vielle and gipsies telling your fortune for the battle and enormous knights with their heads wrapped in untidy turbans playing chess and vivandieres sitting on the knees of some of them and  as for entertainment  there were joculators gleemen tumblers harpers troubadours jesters minstrels tregetours bear dancers egg dancers ladder dancers ballette dancers mountebanks fire eaters and balancers In a way it was like Derby Day The tremendous forest of Sherwood stretched round the tent forest further than the eye could see  and this was full of wild boars warrantable stags outlaws dragons and Purple Emperors There was also an ambush in the forest but nobody was supposed to know about that  King Arthur paid no attention to the coming battle He sat invisible in his pavilion at the hub of the excitement and talked to Sir Ector or Kay or Merlyn day after day The smaller captains were delighted to think that their King was having so many councils of war for they could see the lamp burning inside the silk tent until all hours and they felt sure that he was inventing a splendid plan of campaign Actually the conversation was about different things There will be a lot of jealousy said Kay You will have all these knights in this order of yours saying that they are the best one and wanting to sit at the top of the table  Then we must have a round table with no top  But Arthur you could never sit a hundred and fifty knights at a round table Let me see    Merlyn who hardly ever interfered in the arguments now but sat with his hands folded on his stomach and beamed helped Kay out of the difficulty  It would need to be about fifty yards across he said You do it by 2* r  Well then Say it was fifty yards across Think of all the space in the middle It would be an ocean of wood with a thin rim of humanity You couldnt keep the food in the middle even because nobody would be able to reach it  Then we can have a circular table said Arthur not a round one I dont know what the proper word is I mean we could have a table shaped like the rim of a cart wheel and the servants could walk about in the empty space where the spokes would be We could call them the Knights of the Round Table  What a good name  And the important thing continued the King who was getting wiser the more he thought the most important thing will be to catch them young The old knights the ones we are fighting against will be mostly too old to learn I think we shall be able to get them in and keep them fighting the right way but they will be inclined to stick to the old habits like Sir Bruce Grummore and Pellinore  we must have them of course  I wonder where they are now Grummore and Pellinore will be all right because they were always kindly in thelmselves But I dont think Lots people will ever really be at home with it That is why I say we must catch them young We must breed up a new generation of chivalry for the future That child Lancelot who came over with You know who for instance: we must get hold of kids like him They will be the real Table  Apropos of this Table said Merlyn I dont see why I should not tell you that King Leodegrance has one which would do very well As you are going to marry his daughter he might be persuaded to give you the table as a wedding present  Am I going to marry his daughter  Certainly She is called Guenever Look Merlyn I dont like knowing about the future and I am not sure whether I believe in it  There are some things said the magician which I have to tell you whether you believe them or not The trouble is I cant help feeling there is one thing which I have forgotten to tell Remind me to warn you about Guenever another time  It confuses everybody said Arthur complainingly I get muddled up with half the questions I want to ask you myself For instance who was my  You will have to have special Feasts interrupted Kay at Pentecost and so on when all the knights come to dinner and say what they have done It will make them want to fight in this new way of yours if they are going to recite about it afterwards And Merlyn could write their names in their places by magic and their coat armour could be engraved over their sieges It would be grand  This exciting idea made the King forget his question and the two young men sat down immediately to draw their own blazons for the magician so that there should be no mistake about the tinctures While they were in the middle of the drawing Kay looked up with his tongue between his teeth and remarked:  By the way You remember that argument we were having about aggression Well I have thought of a good reason for starting a war Merlyn froze I would like to hear it  A good reason for starting a war is simply to have a good reason For instance there might be a king who had discovered a new way of life for human beings  you know something which would be good for them It might even be the only way of saving them from destruction Well if the human beings were too wicked or too stupid to accept his way he might have to force it on them in their own interests by the sword  The magician clenched his fists twisted his gown into screws and began to shake all over  Very interesting he said in a trembling voice Very interesting There was just such a man when I was young   an Austrian who invented a new way of life and convinced himself that he was the chap to make it work He tried to impose his reformation by the sword and plunged  the civilized world into misery and chaos But the thing which this fellow had overlooked my friend was that he had had a predecessor in the reformation business called Jesus Christ Perhaps we may assume that Jesus knew as much as the Austrian did about saving people But the odd thing is that Jesus did not turn the disciples into storm troopers burn down the Temple at Jerusalem and fix the blame on Pontius Pilate On the contrary he made it clear that the business of the philosopher was to make ideas available and not to impose them on people  Kay looked pale but obstinate  Arthur is fighting the present war he said to impose his ideas on King Lot  9 The Queens suggestion about hunting unicorns had a curious result The more lovelorn King Pellinore became the more obvious it was that something would have to be done Sir Palomides had an inspiration  The royal melancholy said he can only be dispelled by Questing Beast This is the subject to which the maharajah sahib has been accustomed by lifelong habit Yours truly has said so all along  Personally said Sir Grummore I believe the Questing Beast is dead Anyway it is in Flanders  Then we must dress up said Sir Palomides We must assume the ro1e of Questing Beast and be hunted ourselves  We could scarcely dress as the Beast  But the Saracen had run away with the idea  Why not he asked Why not by Jingo Joculators assume garb of animals  as stags goats and so forth   and dance to bells and tabor with many gyrings and circumflexions  But really Palomides we are not joculators  Then we must learn to be sol  Joculators  A joculator was a juggler a low kind of minstrel and Sir Grummore did not relish the idea at all  However could we dress as the Questin Beast he asked weakly She is a frightfully complicated animal  Describe this animal  Well dash it all She has a snakes head and the body of a leopard and haunches like a lion and feet like a hart And hang it man how could we make this noise in her belly like thirty couple of hounds questin  Yours truly will be the belly replied Sir Palomides and will give tongue as follows  He began yodelling  Hush cried Sir Grummore You will wake the Castle  Then it is agreed  No it is not agreed Never heard such nonsense in me life Besides she dont make a noise like that She makes a noise like this  And Sir Grummore began cackling in a tuneless alto like thousands of wild geese on the Wash  Hush Hush cried Sir Palomides  I wont hush The noise you was makin was like pigs  The two naturalists began hooting grunting squawking squealing crowing mooing growling snuffling quacking snarling and mewing at one another until they were red in the face  The head said Sir Grummore stopping suddenly will have to be of cardboard  Or canvas said Sir Palomides The fishing populace will be in possession of canvas  We can make leather boots for hoofs  Spots can be painted on the body  It will have to button round the middle      where we join  And you added Sir Palomides generously can be the back end and do hounds The noise is plainly stated to come from the belly  Sir Grummore blushed with pleasure and said gruffly in his Norman way Well thanks Palomides I must say I think thats demned decent of you  Not at all  For a week King Pellinore saw hardly anything of his friends You write poems Pellinore they told him or go and sigh on the cuffs theres a good fellow He wandered about occasionally crying out Flanders  Glanders or Daughter  ought to whenever the ideas occurred to him while the dark Queen hung in the background  Meanwhile in Sir Palomides room where the door was kept locked there was such a stitching and snipping and painting and arguing as had seldom been known before  My dear chap I tell you a libbard has black spots  Puce Sir Palomides said obstinately  What is puce And anyway we have not got any  They glared at each other with the fury of creators  Try on the head  There youve torn it I said you would  Construction was of feeble nature  We must construct the thing again  When the reconstruction was finished the paynim stood back to admire it  Look out for the spots Palomides There youve smudged them  A thousand pardons  You ought to look where you are goin  Well who put his foot through the ribs  On the second day there was trouble with the back end  These haunches are too tight  Dont bend over  I have to bend over if I am the back end  They wont split  Yes they will  No they wont  Well they have  Look out for my tail said Sir Grummore on the third day You are treadin on it  Dont hold so tight Grummore My neck is twisted  Cant you see  No I cant My neck is twisted  There goes my tail  There was a pause while they sorted thelmselves out  Now carefully this time We must walk in step  You give the step  Left Right Left Right  I think my haunches are comin down  If you let go of yours trulys waist we shall come in half  Well I cant hold up my haunches unless I do  There go the buttons  Damn the buttons  Yours truly told you so  So they sewed on buttons during the fourth day and started again  Can I practise my bayin now  Yes indeed  How does my bayin sound from inside  It sounds splendid Grummore splendid Only it is strange in a way coming from behind if you follow my argument  I thought it sounded muffled  It did a bit  Perhaps it will be all right from outside  On the fifth day they were far advanced  We ought to practise a gallop After all we cant walk all the time not when he is hunting us  Very good  When I say Go then Go Ready steady Go  Look out Grummore you are butting me  Buttin  Be careful of the bed  What did you say  Oh dear  Confound the bed to blazes Oh my shins  You have burst the buttons again  Damn the buttons I have stubbed my toe  Well yours trulys head has come off also  We shall have to stick to walkin  It would be easier to gallop said Sir Grummore on the sixth day if we had some music Somethin like Tantivvy you know  Well we have not got any music  No  Could you sing out Tantivvy Palomides while I am bayin  Yours truly could try  Very well then off we go  Tantivvy tantivvy tantivvy  Damn  We shall have to make the whole thing again said Sir Palomides over the week end We can still use the hoofs  I dont suppose it will hurt so much fallin down out of doors  not on the moss you know  And probably it wont tear the canvas so badly  We will make it double strength  Yes  I am glad the hoofs will still do  By jove Palomides dont he look a monster  A splendid effort this time  Pity you cant make fire come out of his mouth or somethin  A danger of combustion there  Shall we try another gallop Palomides  By all means  Push the bed in the corner then  Look out for the buttons  If you see anythin we are runnin into just stop see  Yes  Keep a sharp look out Palomides  Right ho Grummore  Ready then  Ready  Off we go  That was a splendid burst Palomides exclaimed the Knight of the Forest Sauvage  A noble gallop  Did you notice how I was bayin all the time  I could not fail to notice it Sir Grummore  Well well I dont know when I have enjoyed myself so much  They panted with triumph standing amid their monster  I say Palomides look at me swishin my tail  Charming Sir Grummore Look at me winking one of my eyes  No no Palomides You look at my tail You ought not to miss it really  Well if I look at you swishing you ought to look at me winking That is only fair  But I cant see anythin from inside  As for that Sir Grummore yours truly cant see so far round as the anal appanage  Now then we will have one last go I shall swish my tail round and round all the time and bay like mad It will be a frightful spectacle  And yours truly will continuously wink one optic or the other  Could we put a bit of a bound into the gallop Palomides every now and then do you think You know a kind of prance  The prance could more naturally be effected by the back end solo  You mean I could do it alone  Effectually  Well I must say that is uncommonly decent of you Palomides to let me do the prancin  Yours truly trusts that a modicum of caution will be exercised in the prance to prevent delivery of uncomfortable blows to the posterior of the forequarters  Just as you say Palomides  Boot and saddle Sir Grummore  Tally ho Sir Palomides  Tantivvy tantivvy tantivvy a questing we will go  The Queen had recognized the impossible Even in the miasma of her Gaelic mind she had come to see that asses do not mate with pythons It was useless to go on dramatizing her charms and talents for the benefit of these ridiculous knights  useless to go on hunting them with the tyrannous baits of what she thought was love With a sudden turn of feeling she discovered that she hated them They were imbeciles as well as being the Sassenach and she herself was a saint She was she discovered with a change of posture interested in nothing but her darling boys She was the best mother to them in the world Her heart ached for them her maternal bosom swelled When Gareth nervously brought white heather to her bedroom as an apology for being whipped she covered him with kisses glancing in the mirror  He escaped from the embrace and dried his tears  partly uncomfortable partly in rapture The heather which he had brought was set up dramatically in a cup with no water  she was every inch the homebody  and he was free to go He scampered from the royal chamber with the news of forgiveness went spinning down the circular stairs like a tee to tum  It was a different castle to the one in which King Arthur used to scamper A Norman would hardly have recognized it as a castle except for the pele tower It was a thousand years more ancient than anything the Normans knew  This castle through which the child was running to  bring the good news of their mothers love to his brothers had begun in the mists of the past as that strange symbol of the Old Ones  a promontory fort Driven to the sea by the volcano of history they had turned at bay on the last peninsula With the sea literally at their backs on a cliffy tongue of land they had built their single wall across the root of the tongue The sea which was their doom had also been their last defender on every other side There on the  promontory the blue painted cannibals had piled up their cyclopean wall of unmortared stones fourteen feet high and equally thick with terraces on the inside from which they could hurl their flints All along the outside of the wall they had embedded thousands of sharp stones in the scraw each stone pointing outward in a chevaux de frise which was like a petrified hedgehog Behind it and behind the enormous wall they had huddled at night in wooden shacks together with their domestic animals There had been heads of enemies erected on poles for decoration and their king had built himself an underground treasure chamber which was also a subterranean passage for escape It had led under the wall so that even if the fort were stormed he could creep out behind the attackers It had been a passage along which only one man could crawl at a time and it had been constructed with a special kink in it at which he could wait to knock a pursuer on the head as the latter negotiated the obstacle The diggers of the souterrain had been executed by their own priest king to keep the secret of it  All that was in an earlier millennium  Dunlothian had grown with the slow conservancy of the Old Ones Here with a Scandinavian conquest had sprung up a wooden long house  there the original stones of the curtain wall had been pulled down to build a round tower for priests The pele tower with a cow byre under the two living chambers had come the last of all  So it was among the untidy wreckage of centuries that Gareth scampered looking for his brothers It was among lean tos and adaptations  past ogham stones commemorating some long dead Deag the son of No built into a later bastion upside down It was on the top of a wind swept cliff purged to the bone by the airs of the Atlantic under which the little fishing village nestled among the dunes It was as the inheritor of a view which covered a dozen miles of rollers and hundreds of miles of cumulus All along the coastline the saints and scholars of Eriu inhabited their stone igloos in holy horribleness  reciting fifty psalms in their beehives and fifty in the open air and fifty with their bodies plunged in cold water in their loathing for the twinkling world St Toirdealbhach was far from typical of their species  Gareth found his brothers in the store room  It smelt of oatmeal ham smoked salmon dried cod onions shark oil pickled herrings in tubs hemp maize hens fluff sailcloth milk  the butter was churned there on Thursdays   seasoning pine wood apples herbs drying fish glue and varnish used by the fletcher spices from overseas dead rat in trap venison seaweed wood shavings litter of kittens fleeces from the mountain sheep not yet sold and the pungent smell of tar  Gawaine Agravaine and Gaheris were sitting on the fleeces eating apples They were in the middle of an argument  It is not our business said Gawaine stubbornly  Agravaine whined: But it is our business It is at us more than anybody and it is not right  How dare you to say that our mother is not right  She is not  She is  If you can but contradict  They are decent for the Sassenach said Gawaine Sir Grummore let me try his helm last night  That has nothing to do with it  Gawaine said: I am not wishing to talk about it It is base to be talking  Pure Gawaine  As Gareth came in he could see Gawaines face flaming at Agravaine under its red hair It was obvious that he was going to have one of his rages  but Agravaine was one of those luckless intellectuals who are too proud to give in to brute force He was the kind who gets knocked down in an argument because he cannot defend himself but continues the argument on the floor sneering Go on then hit me again to show how clever you are  Gawaine glared at him  Silence your mouth  I will not  I will make you  If you will make me or not it will be the same  Gareth said: Be quiet Agravaine Gawaine leave him alone; Agravaine if you do not be quiet he will kill you  I do not care if he does kill me What I say is true  Hold your noise  I will not I say we ought to indite a letter to our father about these knights We ought to tell him about our mother We    Gawaine was upon him before he could finish the sentence  Your soul to the devil he shouted Traitor Ach so you would  For Agravaine had done something unprecedented in the family troubles He was the weaker of the two and he was afraid of pain As he went down he had drawn his dirk upon his brother  Look to his arm cried Gareth  The two were going over and over among the rolled fleeces  Gaheris catch his hand Gawaine leave him alone Agravaine drop it Agravaine if you do not drop it he will kill you Ah you brute  The boys face was blue and the dirk nowhere to be seen Gawaine with his hands round Agravaines throat was ferociously beating his head on the floor Gareth took hold of Gawaines shirt at the neck and twisted it to choke him Gaheris hovering round the edge ferreted for the dirk  Leave me panted Gawaine Let me be He gave a coughing or husky noise in his chest like a young lion making its roar  Agravaine whose Adams apple had been hurt relaxed his muscles and lay hiccoughing with his eyes shut He looked as if he were going to die They dragged Gawaine off and held him down still struggling to get at his victim and finish the work  It was curious that when he was in one of these black passions he seemed to pass out of human life In later days he even killed women when he had been worked into such a state   though he regretted it bitterly afterwards  When the counterfeit Beast was perfected the knights took it away and hid it in a cave at the foot of the cliffs above high water mark Then they had some whisky to celebrate and set off in search of the King as darkness fell  They found him in his chamber with a quill pen and a  sheet of parchment There was no poetry on the parchment   only a picture which was intended to be a heart transfixed by an arrow with two Ps drawn inside it interlaced The King was blowing his nose  Excuse me Pellinore said Sir Grummore but we have seen something on the cliffs  Something nasty  Well not exactly  I hoped it would be  Sir Grummore thought the situation over and drew the Saracen aside They decided that tact was needed  Oh Pellinore said Sir Grummore nonchalantly what is this that you are drawin  What do you think it is  It looks like a sort of drawin  That is what it is said the King I wish you two would go away I mean if you could take a hint  It would be better if you were to make a line here pursued Sir Grummore  Where  Here where the pig is  My dear fellow I dont know what you are talking about  I am sorry Pellinore I thought you was drawin a pig with your eyes shut  Sir Palomides thought it was time to interfere  Sir Grummore he said coyly has observed a phenomenon by Jove  A phenomenon  A thing explained Sir Grummore  What sort of thing asked the King suspiciously  Something you will like  It has four legs added the Saracen  Is it animal asked the King vegetable or mineral  Animal  A pig inquired the King who was beginning to feel they must be driving at something  No no Pellinore Not a pig Get pigs out of your head right away This thing makes a noise like hounds  Like sixty hounds explained Sir Palomides  It is a whale cried the King  No no Pellinore A whale has no legs  But it makes such a noise  Does a whale  My dear fellow how am I to know You must try to keep the issue clear  I see but what is the issue what It seems to be a menagerie game  No no Pellinore It is something we have seen which bays  Oh I say he wailed I do wish you two would either shut up or go away What with whales and pigs and now this thing which bays a fellow does not know where he is half the  time Cant you leave a fellow alone to draw his little things and hang himself quietly for once I mean to say it is not much to ask is it what dont you know  Pellinore said Sir Grummore you must pull yourself together We have seen the Questing Beast  Why  Why  Yes why  Why do you say why  I mean explained Sir Grummore you could say Where or When But why Why  Why not  Pellinore have you lost all sense of decency We have seen the Questing Beast I tell you   seen it on the cliffs here quite close  It is not an it It is a She  My dear chap it doesnt matter what she is We have seen her  Then why dont you go and catch her  It is not for us to catch her Pellinore It is for you After all she is your lifes work isnt she  Shes stupid said the King  She may be stupid or she may not said Sir Grummore in an offended tone The point is she is your magnum opus Only a Pellinore can catch her You have told us so often  What is the point of catching her asked the monarch What After all she is probably quite happy on the cliffs I dont see what you are fussing about  It seems dreadfully sad he added at a tangent that people cant be married when they want to I mean what is the good of this animal to me I have not married it have I So why am I chasing it all the time It doesnt seem logical  What you want Pellinore is a good hunt Shake up your liver  They took away his pen and poured him several bumpers of usquebaugh not forgetting to take a nip or two thelmselves  It seems the only thing to do he said suddenly After all only a Pellinore can catch it  Thats the brave fellow  Only I do feel sad sometimes he added before they could stop him about the Queen of Flanders daughter She was not beautiful Grummore but she understood me We seemed to get on together if you see what I mean I amnt clever perhaps and I may get into trouble when I am by myself but when I was with Piggy she always knew what to do It was company too It is not bad to have a bit of company when you are getting on in life especially when you have been chasing the Questing Beast all the time what It gets a bit lonely in the Forest Not that the Questing Beast wasnt company in her way  so far as she went Only you couldnt talk things over with her not like with Piggy And she couldnt cook I dont know why I am boring you fellows with all this talk but really sometimes one feels as if one could hardly carry on It is not as if Piggy were a flapper you see I really did love her Grummore really and if only she would have answered my letters it would have been ever so nice  Poor old Pellinore they said  I saw seven maggot pies today Palomides They were flying along like frying pans  One for sorrow explained the King Two for joy three for a marriage and four for a boy So seven ought to be four boys ought it what  Bound to be said Sir Grummore  They were going to be called Aglovale Percivale and Lamorak and then there was one with a funny name which I cant remember Thats all off now Still I must say I would have liked to have had a son called Dornar  Look here Pellinore you must learn to let bygones be bygones You will only wear yourself out Why dont you be a brave chap and catch your Beast for instance  I suppose I must  Thats it Take your mind off things  It is eighteen years since I have been after it said the  King pensively It would be a change to catch it I wonder where the brachet is  Ah Pellinore Now youre talking  Suppose our honoured monarch were to start at once  What This evening Palomides In the dark  Sir Palomides nudged Sir Grummore secretly Administer blows to iron he whispered while at high temperature  I see what you mean  I dont suppose it matters said the King Nothing does really  Very well then cried Sir Grummore taking control of the situation That is what we will do We will put old Pellinore at one end of the cliffs this very night in an ambush and then we two will drive the place methodically toward him The Beast is bound to be there as it was seen only this afternoon  Dont you think he inquired as they were dressing up in the darkness that it was clever the way I explained about our bein here I mean to drive the animal  An inspiration said Sir Palomides Is my head on straight  My dear chap I cant see an inch  The Saracens voice sounded uneasy  This darkness he said seems jolly palpable  Never mind said Sir Grummore It will hide any little faults in our make up Perhaps the moon will come out later  Thank goodness his sword is generally blunt  Oh come now Palomides you mustnt get cold feet I cant think why it is but I feel perfectly splendid Perhaps it was those bumpers I am goin to prance and bay tonight I can tell you  You are buttoning yourself to me Sir Grummore Those are the wrong buttons  Beg pardon Palomides  Would it be enough if you were to wave your tail in the air instead of prancing There is a certain discomfort for the forequarters during the prance  I shall wave my tail as well as prance said Sir Grummore firmly  Just as you say  Take your hoof off my tail for a moment Palomides  Could you carry your tail over your arm for the first part of the journey  It would hardly be natural  No  And now added Sir Palomides bitterly it is going to rain Come to think of it it nearly always does rain in these parts  He thrust his brown hand out of the serpents mouth and felt the drops on the back of it They drummed on the canvas like hail  Dear old forequarters said Sir Grummore cheerfully for he had plenty of whisky it was you who thought of this expedition in the first place Cheer up old blackamoor It will be much worse for Pellinore waitin for us to come After all he has not got a canvas hide with spots on it to shelter under  Perhaps it will stop  Of course it will stop Thats the ticket old pagan Now then are we ready  Yes  Give the step then  Left Right  Dont forget the Tantivvy  Left Right Tantivvy Tantivvy I beg your pardon  I was only bayin  Tantivvy Tantivvy   Now for the prance  Oh dear Sir Grummore  Sorry Palomides  Yours truly will hardly be able to sit down  Under the dripping cliffs King Pellinore stood stock still looking vaguely in front of him His brachet on a long string was wound round him several times He was in full armour which was getting rusty and the rain came in at five places It ran down both shins and both forearms but the worst place was his vizor This was constructed on the snout principle since it was found that if one had an ugly helmet it frightened the enemy King Pellinores looked like an inquisitive pig It let the rain in through the nostrils however and the water ran down in front in a steady trickle which tickled his chest The King was thinking  Well he thought he supposed this would keep them quiet It was not very nice in all this rain and everything but the dear fellows seemed keen on it It would be difficult to find anybody kinder than old Grum and Palomides seemed a friendly chap though he was a paynim If they wanted to have a lark like this it was only decent to humour them Besides it was nice for the brachet to have an outing It was a pity that it could never keep unwound but there you could not interfere with nature He would have to spend all tomorrow scrubbing his armour  It would give him something to do reflected the King miserably which was better than wandering about all the time with his eternal sorrow gnawing at his heart And he fell to thinking about Piggy  The nice thing about the Queen of Flanders daughter had been that she did not laugh at him A lot of people laughed at you when you went after the Questing Beast   and never caught it  but Piggy never laughed She seemed to understand at once how interesting it was and made several sensible suggestions about the way to trap it Naturally one did not pretend to be clever or anything but it was nice not to be laughed at One was doing ones best  And then the dreadful day had come when that cursed boat had floated to the shore They had got into it because knights must always accept an adventure and it had sailed away at once They had waved to Piggy ever so and the Beast had put its head out of the wood and waded out to sea after them looking most upset But the boat had gone on and on and the small figures on the shore had dwindled till they could hardly see the kerchief which Piggy was waving and then the brachet had been sick  From every port he had written to her He had given letters to the innkeepers everywhere and they had promised to send them on But she had never sent a syllable in reply  It was because he was uhworthy decided the King He was vague and not clever and always getting in a muddle Why should the daughter of the Queen of Flanders write to a person like that especially when he had gone and got into a magic boat and sailed away It was like deserting her and of course she was right to be angry Meanwhile it would keep raining and the water did trickle so and now that brachet was sneezing The armour would be rusty and there was a sort of draught down the back of his neck where the helmet screwed on ft was dark and horrible Some sticky stuff was dripping off the cliffs  Excuse me Sir Grummore but is that you snuffling in my ear  No no my dear fellow Go on go on I am only doin my bayin as well as I can  It is not the baying I refer to Sir Grummore but a kind of breathing noise of a husky nature  My dear chap it is no good askin me All you can hear in here is a kind of creakin like a bellows  Yours truly thinks the rain is going to stop Do you mind if we stop too  Well Palomides if you must stop you must But if we dont get this over quickly I shall get my stitch again What do you want to stop for  I wish it was not so dark  But you cant stop just because it is dark  No One appreciates that  Go on then old boy Left Right Thats the ticket  I say Grummore said Sir Palomides later There it is again  What is  The puffing Sir Grummore  Are you sure it is not me inquired Sir Grummore  Positive It is a menacing of amorous puff similar to the grampus This paynim sincerely wishes that it were not so dark  Ah well we cant have everythin Now march on Palomides theres a good fellow do  After a bit Sir Grummore said sepulchrally:  Dear old boy cant you stop bumpin all the time  But I am not bumping Sir Grummore  Well what is then  Yours faithfully can feel no bumps  Somethin* keeps bumpin me behind  Is it your tail perhaps  No I have that wound round me  In any case it would be impossible to bump you from the back because the forelegs are in front  There it is again  What  The bump It was a definite assault Palomides we are bein attacked  No no Sir Grummore You are imagining things  Palomides we must turn round  What for Sir Grummore  To see what is bumping me behind  Yours truly can see nothing Sir Grummore It is too dark  Put your hand out of your mouth and see what you can feel  I can feel a sort of round thing  That is me Sir Palomides That is me from the back  Sincere apologies Sir Grummore  Not at all my dear chap not at all What else can you feel  The kindly Saracens voice began to falter  Something cold he said and  slippery  Does it move Palomides  It moves and  it snuffles  Snuffles  Snuffles  At this moment the moon came out  Merciful powers cried Sir Palomides in a high squealing voice as he peered out of his mouth Run Grummore run Left right Quick march Double march Faster faster Keep in step Oh my poor heels Oh my God Oh my hat  It was no good decided the King Probably they had got lost or wandered off somewhere to amuse thelmselves It was beastly wet as it nearly always was in Lothian and really he had done his best to fall in with their plans Now they had wandered off  one might almost say inconsiderately   and left him with his wretched brachet to get rusty It was too bad  With a determined motion he marched away to bed heaving the brachet along behind him  Half way up a fissure in one of the steepest cliffs with most of its buttons burst the counterfeit Beast was arguing with its stomach  But my dear knight how could yours truly foresee a calamity of this nature  You thought of it replied the stomach furiously You made us dress up It is your fault  At the foot of the cliff the Questing Beast herself in a sentimental attitude waited in the romantic moonlight for her better half Behind her was a background of the silver sea In various parts of the landscape several dozens of bent and distorted Old Ones were intently examining the situation from the concealment of rocks sandhills shell mounds igloos and so forth  still vainly trying to fathom the subtle secrets of the English  10 In Bedegrdne it was the night before the battle A number of bishops were blessing the armies on both sides hearing confessions and saying Mass Arthurs men were reverent about this but King Lots men were not  for such was the custom in all armies that were going to be defeated The bishops assured both sides that they were certain to win because God was with them but King Arthurs men knew that they were outnumbered by three to one so they  thought ft was best to get shriven King Lots men who also knew the odds spent the night dancing drinking dicing and telling each other dirty stories This is what the chronicles say at any rate  In the King of Englands tent the last staff talk had been held and Merlyn had stayed behind to have a chat He was looking worried  What are you worried about Merlyn Are we going to lose this battle after all  No You will win the battle all right There is no harm in telling you so You will do your best and fight hard and call in You know whom at the right moment It will be in your nature to win the battle so it doesnt matter telling you No It is something else which I ought to have told you that is worrying me just now  What was it about  Gracious heavens Why should I be worrying if I could remember what it was about  Was it about the maiden called Nimue  No No No No Thats quite a different business It was something  it was something I cant remember  After a bit Merlyn took his beard out of his mouth and began counting on his fingers  I have told you about Guenever havent I  I dont believe it  No matter And I have warned you about her and Lancelot  That warning said the King would be a base one anyway whether it was true or false  Then I have said the bit about Excalibur and how you must be careful of the sheath  Yes  I have told you about your father so it cant be him and I have given the hint about the person  What is confounding me exclaimed the magician pulling out his hair in tufts is that I cant remember whether it is in the future or in the past  Never mind about it said Arthur I dont like knowing the future anyway I had much rather you didnt worry about it because it only worries me  But it is something I must say It is vital  Stop thinking about it suggested the King and then perhaps it will come back You ought to take a holiday You have been bothering your head too much lately what with all these warnings and arranging about the battle  I will take a holiday exclaimed Merlyn As soon as this battle is over I will go on a walking tour into North Humberland I have a Master called Bleise who lives in North Humberland and perhaps he will be able to tell me what it is I am trying to remember Then we could have some wild fowl watching He is a great man for wild fowl  Good said Arthur You take a long holiday Then when you come back we can think of something to prevent Nimue  The old man stopped fiddling with his fingers and looked sharply at the King  You are an innocent fellow Arthur he said And a good thing too really  Why  Do you remember anythingabout the magic you had when you were small  No Did I have some magic I can remember that I was interested in birds and beasts Indeed that is why I still keep my menagerie at the Tower But I dont remember about magic  People dont remember said Merlyn I suppose you wouldnt remember about the parables I used to tell you when I was trying to explain things  Of course I do There was one about some Rabbi or other which you told me when I wanted to take Kay somewhere I never could understand why the cow died  Well I want to tell you another parable now  I shall love it  In the East perhaps in the same place which that Rabbi Jachanan came from there was a certain man who was walking in the market of Damascus when he came face to face with Death He noticed an expression of surprise on the spectres horrid countenance but they passed one another without speaking The fellow was frightened and went to a wise man to ask what should be done The wise man told him that Death had probably come to Damascus to fetch him away next morning The poor man was terrified at this and asked however he could escape The only way they could think of between them was that the victim should ride all night to Aleppo thus eluding the skull and bloody bones  So this man did ride to Aleppo  it was a terrible ride which had never been done in one night before  and when he was there he walked in the market place congratulating himself on having eluded Death  Just then Death came up to him and tapped him on the shoulder Excuse me he said but I have come for you Why exclaimed the terrified man I thought I met you in Damascus  yesterday Exactly said Death That was why I looked surprised  for I had been told to meet you today in Aleppo  Arthur reflected on this gruesome chestnut for some time then he said:  So it is no good trying to escape Nimue  Even if I wanted to said Merlyn it would be no good There is a thing about Time and Space which the philosopher Einstein is going to find out Some people call it Destiny  But what I cant get over is this toad in the hole business  Ah well said Merlyn people will do a lot for love And then the toad is not necessarily unhappy in its hole not more than when you are asleep for instance I shall do some considering until they let me out again  So they will let you out  I will tell you something else King which may be a surprise for you It will not happen for hundreds of years but both of us are to come back Do you know what is going to be written on your tombstone Hic jacet Arthurus Rex quondam Rexque futurus Do you remember your Latin It means the once and future king  I am to come back as well as you  Some say from the vale of Avilion  The King thought about it in silence It was full night outside and there was stillness in the bright pavilion The sentries moving on the grass could not be heard  I wonder he said at last whether they will remember about our Table  Merlyn did not answer His head was bowed on the white beard and his hands clasped between his knees  What sort of people will they be Merlyn cried the young mans voice unhappily  11 The Queen of Lothian had taken to her chamber cutting off communication with her guests and Pellinore broke his fast alone Afterwards he went for a walk along the beach admiring the gulls who flew above him like white quill pens whose heads had been neatly dipped in ink The old cormorants stood like crucifixes on the rocks drying their wings He was feeling sad as usual but he was also feeling uncomfortable because he was missing something He did not know what it was He was missing Palomides and Grummore if he had been able to remember  Presently he was attracted by shouting and went to investigate  Here Pellinore Hi We are over here Why Grummore he asked with interest whatever are you doing up that cliff  Look at the Beast man look at the Beast  Oh hallo you have got old Glatisant  My dear chap for heavens sake do something We have been here all night  But why are you dressed up like that Grummore You have got spots or something And what has Palomides got on his head  Dont stand there arguin man  But you have a sort of tail Grummore I can see it hanging down behind  Of course I have a tail Cant you stop talkin and do somethin We have been in this damned crevice all night and we are droppin with fatigue Go on Pellinore kill that Beast of yours at once  Oh I say whatever should I want to kill her for  Good gracious heavens havent you been tryin to kill her for the last eighteen years Now come along Pellinore be a good chap and do somethin If you dont do somethin quick we shall both tumble out  What I cant understand said the King plaintively is why you should be in this cliff at all And why are you dressed up like that You look as if you were dressed as a sort of Beast yourselves And where did the Beast come from anyway what I mean the whole thing is so sudden  Pellinore once and for all will you kill that Beast  Why  Because it has chased us up this cliff  It is unusual for the Beast remarked the King She does not generally take an interest in people like this  Palomides said Sir Grummore hoarsely says he believes she has fallen in love with us  Fallen in love  Well you see we were dressed up as a Beast  Like likes Like explained Sir Palomides faintly  King Pellinore slowly began to laugh for the first time since he had arrived in Lothian  Welll he said Bless my soul Did you ever hear of anything to match it Why does Palomides think she has fallen for him  The Beast said Sir Grummore with dignity has been walkin round and round the cliff all night She has been rubbin herself against it and purrin And she sometimes curls her neck round the rocks and gazes up at us in a sort of way  What sort of way Grummore  My dear fellow look at her now  The Questing Beast who had not paid the least attention to the arrival of her master was staring up at Sir Palomides with her soul in her eyes Her chin was pressed to the foot of the cliffs in a passion of devotion and occasionally she gave her tail a wag She moved it laterally on the surface of pebbles where its numerous heraldic tufts and foliations made a rustling noise and sometimes she scratched the bluff with a small whimper Then feeling that she had been too forward she would arch her graceful serpent neck and hide her head beneath her belly peeping upwards from the corner of one eye  Well Grummore what do you want me to do  We want to come down said Sir Grummore  I can see that said the King It seems a sensible idea Mind you I dont understand exactly how the whole thing started what but I can see that absolutely  Then kill it Pellinore Kill the wretched creature  Oh really said the King I dont know about that After all what harm has she done All the world loves a lover I dont see why the poor beastie should be killed just because she has got the gentle passion I mean to say I am in love myself amnt I what It gives you a sort of fellow feeling  King Pellinore said Sir Palomides definitely unless some steps are taken pretty dam quick yours affectionately will be instantaneously martyred RIP  But my dear Palomides I cant possibly kill the old Beast dont you see because my sword is blunt  Then stun her with it Pellinore Give her a good bang on the head with it man and perhaps she will get concussion  That is all very well for you Grummore old fellow But suppose it doesnt stun her It might make her lose her temper Grummore and then where should I be Personally I cant see why you should want to have the creature assaulted at all After all she is in love with you isnt she what  Whatever the reasons for the animals behaviour the point is we are on this ledge  Then all you need to do is to come off it  My good man how can we come down to be attacked  It will only be a loving sort of attack the King pointed out reassuringly Sort of making advances I dont suppose she will do you any harm All you would have to do would be to walk along in front of her until you reached the castle what As a matter of fact you could perhaps encourage her a bit After all everybody likes to have their affection returned  Are you suggesting asked Sir Grummore coldly that we should flirt with this reptile of yours  It would certainly make it easier I mean the walk back  And how are we to do this pray  Well Palomides could twine his neck round hers occasionally you know and you could wag your tail I suppose you could not lick her nose  Yours truly said Sir Palomides feebly finally and with aversion can neither twine nor lick Also he is now about to fall Adieu  With this the unfortunate paynim let go of the cliff with both hands and appeared to be sinking into the monsters jaws  but that Sir Grummore caught him and the remaining buttons held him in position  There said Sir Grummore Now look what you have done  But my dear fellow  I am not your dear fellow You are simply abandonin us to destruction  Oh I say  Yes you are Heartlessly  The King scratched his head  I suppose he said doubtfully I could hold her by the tail while you made a dash for it  Then do so If you dont do somethin immediately Palomides will fall and then we shall come in half  I still dont see said the King sadly why you had to dress up like this to begin with It is all a mystery to me  However he added taking the Beast by the tail come on old girl Heave ho We shall have to do the best we can in the circumstances Now then you two run for your lives Hurry up Grummore I dont think the Beast is pleased by the feel of her Ah you naughty thing leave it Run Grummore Naughty Beast Pah Nasty nasty Leave it Quick man quick Come away then Dont touch Trust Shell be off in a minute Come to heel will you Heel  Come behind Oh you horrid Beast Faster Grummore Sit sit Lie down Beast How dare you Look out man shes coming Oh you would would you There Now shes bitten me  They won the drawbridge by a short head and it was drawn up after them in the nick of time  Phew said Sir Grummore unbuttoning the back end and standing up to mop his brow  Hoots cried various auld wives who were in the castle delivering eggs Some of the castle circle could speak English after a fashion including St Toirdealbhach and Mother Morlan  Wee sleekit cowring timorous Beastie said the drawbridge man Oh what a panics in thy breastie  Aroint us said the bystanders  Bonnie Sir Palomides said a number of Old Ones who had known of their plight on the cliff ledge all night   without saying anything about it as was their custom for fear of being caught out is going to lay him doon and dee  They turned round to examine the paynim and found that it was as they said Sir Palomides had collapsed on a stone mounting block without troubling to take his head off and was breathing heavily They took it off for him and threw a bucket of water in his face Then they fanned him with their aprons  Ah the puir churl they said compassionately The sassenagh The sable savage Will he no come back again Gie him anither drappie there Ah the braw splash  Sir Palomides revived slowly blowing bubbles out of his nose  Where is yours truly he asked  Here we are old boy We got back safe The Beast is outside  Through the portcullis there came a sorrowful howling to bear out Sir Grummores statement as it had been thirty couple of hounds baying the moon Sir Palomides shuddered  We ought to look out to see if King Pellinore is comin  Yes Sir Grummore Allow one sec for recuperation  The Beast may have done him a mischief  Poor fellow  How do you feel yourself  The indisposition is passing said Sir Palomides bravely  Not much time to waste It may be eatin him at this moment  Lead on said the paynim heaving himself to his feet Forward to the battlements  So the whole party set off to climb the narrow stairs of the Pele Tower  Below them looking small and upside down from this height the Questing Beast could be seen sitting in the ravine which bounded the castle on that side She was sitting on a boulder in it with her tail in the burn and looking up at the drawbridge with her head on one side Her tongue was hanging out Nothing could be seen of Pellinore  Evidently she is not eatin him said Sir Grummore  Unless she has eaten him  I hardly think she would have had time to do that old boy not in the time  You would think she would have left some bones or something Or at any rate the armour  Quite  What do you think we ought to do  It seems bafflin  Do you think we ought to make a sortie  We could wait to see what happens Palomides dont you think  No leaps assented Sir Palomides without previous looks  After they had been watching for half an hour or so the faction of the Old Ones grew bored with the lack of entertainment They clattered off down the stairs to throw stones at the Questing Beast off the top of the wall The two knights stayed on the lookout  This is a pretty state of affairs  Indeed it is  I mean when you work it out  Exactly  Here is the Queen of Orkney angry about something on one side  I could not help noticing that she seemed a little queer about that unicorn  and Pellinore moping on the other And you are supposed to be in love with La Beale Isoud isnt it And now this Beast is after both of us  A confusing situation  Love said Sir Grummore uneasily is a pretty strong passion when you come to think of it  At this moment as if to confirm Sir Grummores opinion a pair of enlaced figures sauntered along the cliff road  Good gracious exclaimed Sir Grummore What are these  As they drew nearer their identity became clear One of them was King Pellinore and he had his arm round the waist of a stout middle aged lady in a side saddle skirt She had a red horsey face and carried a hunting crop in her free hand Her hair was in a bun  It must be the Queen of Flanders daughter  I say you two cried King Pellinore as soon as he had observed them I say look here what do you think can you guess Whoever would have thought it what What do you think I have found  Aha cried the stout lady in a booming voice archly tapping his cheek with her hunting crop But who did the findin eh  Yes yes I know It was not me that found her at all; it was she that found met What do you think of that  And do you know what went on the King in high delight None of my letters could possibly be answered I never put our address on them We hadnt got one I always knew there was something wrong So Piggy got on her horse you know and came huntin after me by moor and fell The Questing Beast helped her a great deal  it has an excellent nose  and that magic barge of ours can you imagine it must have had an idea or two in its head for it went back to fetch them when it saw that I was upset How nice of it They found it in a creek somewhere and here they are  But why are we standing about shouted the King He was so excited that nobody else had time to talk I mean to say why are we shouting so Is it polite do you think Ought you two to come down and let us in What is wrong with this drawbridge anyway  It is the Beast Pellinore the Beast She is in the ravine What is wrong with the Beast She is besiegin the castle  Oh yes said the King Now I remember She bit me  And what do you think he went on waving one hand in the air to show that ft was bandaged Piggy tied it up for me like one oclock She tied it up with a bit of  well you know  Petticoats boomed the Queen of Flanders daughter Yes yes her petticoats  The King was convulsed with giggles  That is all very well Pellinore that is all very well But what are you goin to do about the Beast  His Majesty was intoxicated with gaiety Ho the Beast he cried Is that the trouble Ill soon settle her  Now then he exclaimed marching to the edge of the ravine and waving his sword Now then Off you go Shoo Shoo  The Questing Beast looked at him absently She moved her tail in a vague gesture of recognition then returned her attention to the gatehouse The occasional stones which were being thrown at her by the Old Ones she dexterously caught and swallowed in the maddening way which chickens have when you are trying to drive them off  Let down the drawbridge commanded the King I will attend to her Shoo now shoo  The drawbridge was lowered with hesitation The Beast immediately drew closer to it with a hopeful expression  Now then cried the King You rush in while I defend the rear  The drawbridge reached the ground and Piggy was speeding across before it touched King Pellinore less agile or more bemused by the gentle passion collided with her in the gateway The Questing Beast ran into them behind knocking the King flat  Beware Beware cried all the retainers fishwives falconers farriers fletchers and other well wishers who were assembled within  The Queen of Flanders daughter turned like a tigress to defend her young  Be off you shameless hussy she cried bringing her hunting crop down on the creatures nose The Questing Beast recoiled with the tears springing to its eyes and the portcullis crashed between them  In the evening a new crisis began to develop It became obvious that Glatisant intended to besiege the castle until her mate had been produced and in these circumstances the Old Ones who had brought their eggs to market refused to leave the gate without an escort Eventually the three southern knights had to convoy them to the foot of the cliff with drawn swords in their hands  In the village street St Toirdealbhach was waiting to receive the convoy a raffish Silenus supported by four small boys His breath smelt strongly of whisky and he was in tearing spirits waving his shillelagh  Not a one more stories he was shouting Am not I going to be married wid ould Mother Morlan and after having a fight wid Duncan this minute and never more to be a saint  Congratulations the children told him for the hundredth time  We are all right also added Gareth We are allowed to serve at dinner every day Glory be to God Is it every day begor Yes and our mother takes us for walks Well there now Praise youth and it will corne The saint caught sight of the convoy and began to howl tike an Iroquois Up the ribels  Be easy now they told him Be easy your Holiness The swords are not for fighting with at all  Why wouldnt they be he inquired indignantly and he proceeded to kiss King Pellinore and breathe on him The King said: I say are you really going to be married So am I Are you excited  For answer the holy man twined his arms round the Kings neck and drew him into Mother Morlans shebeen   not entirely to Pellinores satisfaction for he would have liked to hurry back to Piggy  but it was obvious that a bachelor party would have to be held in celebration The whole Gaelic miasma had faded like the mist it was   whether under the influence of love or of whisky or of its own nature as mist  and the three southerners found thelmselves accepted at last as individuals and guests irrespective of the racial trauma into the warm heart of the North  12 The battle of Bedegraine was fought near Sorhaute in the forest of Sherwood during the Whitsun holiday It was a decisive battle because it was in some ways the twelfth century equivalent of what later came to be called a Total War  The Eleven Kings were ready to fight their sovereign in the Norman way  in the foxhunting way of Henry the Second and of his sons  for sport and acquisition and without the real intention of doing each other a personal injury They  the kings with the tank like knights of their nobility   were prepared to take a sporting risk It was the kind of risk which Jorrocks talked about King Lot might have said with justice that the rebellion which he led against Arthur was the image of foxhunting without its guilt and only twenty five per cent of its danger  But the Eleven Kings needed a background for their exploits Even if the knights had little wish to kill each other on the grand scale there was no reason why they should not kill the serfs It would have been a poor days sport indeed according to their estimation without a bag to count at the end of it  So the war as the rebel lords had wished to fight it was a kind of double battle or a war within a war On the outer circle there were sixty thousand kerns and gallow glasses marching with the Eleven and these ill armed levies of the Old Ones were inflamed against the twenty thousand foot soldiers of Arthurs Sassenach army by the tragedy of the Gael Between the armies there was a serious racial enmity But it was an enmity controlled from above  by nobles who were not sincerely anxious for each others blood The armies were packs of hounds as it were whose struggle with each other was to be commanded by Masters of Hounds who took the matter as an exciting gamble If the hounds had turned mutinous for instance Lot and his allies would have been ready to ride with Arthurs knights in quelling what they would have considered a real rebellion  The nobles of the inner circle on both sides were in a way traditionally more friendly with each other than with their own men For them the numbers were necessary for the sake of the bag and for scenic purposes For them a good war had to be full of arms shoulders and heads flying about the field and blows ringing by the water and the wood But the arms  shoulders and heads would be those of villeins and the blows which rang without removing many limbs would be exchanged by the iron nobility Such at any rate was the idea of battle in Lots command When sufficient kerns had been decapitated and sufficient rough handling had been dealt out to the English captains Arthur would recognize the impossibility of further resistance He would capitulate Financial terms of peace would be agreed on  which would yield an excellent profit in ransoms  and all would be more or less as it had been before  except that the fiction of feudal overlordship would be abolished Which was a fiction in any case  Naturally a war of this sort was likely to be hedged with etiquette just as foxhunting is hedged with it It would begin at the advertised meet weather permitting and it would be conducted according to precedent  But Arthur had a different idea in his head It did not seem to him to be sporting after all that eighty thousand humble men should be leud against each other while a fraction of their number in carapaces like the skins of tanks manoeuvred for the sake of ransom He had begun to set a value on heads shoulders and arms  their owners value even if the owner was a serf Merlyn had taught him to distrust the logic by which countrysides could be pillaged for forage husbandmen ruined soldiers slaughtered so that he himself should pay a scathless ransom like the Coeur de Lion of the legends  The King of England had ordered that there were to be no ransoms in his sort of battle His knights were to fight not against gallowglasses but against the knights of the Gaelic Confederation Let the gallowglasses fight among thelmselves if they must  indeed since there was a real aggression for them to settle apart from the question of ransoms let them fight to the best of their ability But as for his nobles they were to attack the nobles of the rebels as if they were gallowglasses and nothing more They were to accept no composition observe no ballet dancers rules They were to press the war home to its real lords  until they thelmselves were ready to refrain from warfare being confronted with its reality  Afterwards he knew for certain now it was to be the destiny of his life to deal with every way of twisting decency by threats of Power  So we may well believe that the Kings men were shriven on the night before they fought Something of the young mans vision had penetrated to his captains and his soldiers Something of the new ideal of the Round Table which was to be born in pain something about doing a hateful and dangerous action for the sake of decency  for they knew that the fight was to be fought in blood and death without reward They would get nothing but the unmarketable conscience of having done what they ought to do in spite of fear  something which wicked people have often debased by calling it glory with too much sentiment but which is glory all the same This idea was in the hearts of the young men who knelt before the God distributing bishops  knowing that the odds were three to one and that their own warm bodies might be cold at sunset  Arthur began with an atrocity and continued with other atrocities The first one was that he did not wait the fashionable hour He ought to have marshalled his Battle opposite Lots as soon as their breakfast was over and then at about midday when the lines were properly in order he should have given the signal to begin The signal having been given he should have charged Lots footmen with his knights while Lots knights charged his footmen and there would have been a splendid slaughter  Instead he attacked by night In the darkness with a war whoop  deplorable and ungentlemanly tactics  he fell on the insurgent camp with the blood pounding in the veins of his neck and Excalibur dancing in his hand He had taken the odds three to one In knights he was wildly outmatched A single King of the rebels  the King of the Hundred Knights  had with his own forces two thirds of the total number to which the Round Table was ever to grow And Arthur had not started the war He was fighting in his own country hundreds of miles within his own borders against an aggression which he had not provoked  Down came the tents up flared the torches out flew the blades and the yell of battle mingled with the lamentation of surprise The noise the slaughtering and slaughtered demons black against the flames  what scenes there have been in Sherwood where now the oak trees crowd into a shade  It was a masterful start and it was rewarded by success The Eleven Kings and their baronage were in armour already  it took so long to arm a nobleman that he was often accomplished overnight If they had not been it might have been an almost bloodless victory Instead it was an initiative and the initiative held The chivalry of the Old Ones fought their way from the ruined encampment hand to hand They managed to unite into an armoured regiment   which was still several times larger than anything in armour which the King could bring against them  but they were deprived of their accustomed screen of footmen There had been no time to organize the gallowglasses and such of these as did remain with the nobility were demoralized or leaderless Arthur detached his own footmen under Merlyn to deal with the infantry battle which was centred round the camp and he himself pressed on with his cavalry against the kings thelmselves He had them on the run and saw that he must keep them on it They were indignantly surprised by what they considered an unchivalrous personal outrage   outrageous to be attacked with positive manslaughter as if a baron could be killed like a Saxon kern  The Kings second atrocity was that he neglected the kerns thelmselves That part of the battle the racial struggle which had a certain reality even if it was a wicked one he left to the races thelmselves  to the infantry and to Merlyns direction at the struggling camp from which the cavalry was already sweeping away There were three Gaels to every Gall among the tents but they were surprised and taken at a disadvantage He wished them no particular harm  concentrating his indignation upon the leaders who had seduced their addled pates   but he knew that they would have to be allowed their fight He hoped that it would be a victorious one so far as his own troops were concerned In the meantime his business was with the leaders  and as the day dawned the atrociousness of his conduct became apparent  For the Eleven Kings had assembled some apology for an infantry screen behind which to wait his charges He ought to have charged this screen of terrified men dealing them an enormous execution Instead he neglected them He galloped through the infantry as if they were not his enemies at all  not even troubling to strike at them  pressing his charge against the armoured core itself The infantry for their part accepted the mercy only too thankfully They behaved as if it was not an honour to be allowed to die for Lothian The discipline as the rebel generals said afterwards was not Pictish  The charges began with the growing day  At a military tattoo perhaps or at some old piece of show ground pageantry you may have seen a cavalry charge If so you know that seen is not the word It is heard  the thunder  earthshake drum fire of the bright and battering sandals Yes and even then it is only a cavalry charge you are thinking of not a chivalry one Imagine it now with the horses twice as heavy as the soft mouthed hunters of our own midnight pageants with the men thelmselves twice heavier on account of arms and shield Add the cymbal music of the clashing armour to the jingle of the harness Turn the uniforms into mirrors blazing with the sun the lances into spears of steel Now the spears dip and now they are coming The earth quakes under feet Behind among the flying clods there are hoof prints stricken in the ground It is not the men that are to be feared not their swords nor even their spears but the hoofs of the horses It is the impetus of that shattering phalanx of iron  spread across the battlefront inescapable pulverizing louder than drums beating the earth  The knights of the confederation met the outrage as they could They stood to it and fought back But the novelty of their situation as objects of ferocity in spite of their rank and also as a large body being charged with arrogance by a body numbering less than a quarter of their own  and being charged again and again into the bargain  this had an effect on their morale They gave ground before the charges still orderly but giving and were shepherded along a glade of Sherwood forest  a wide glade like an estuary of grass with trees on either side  During this phase of the battle there was a display of bravery by various individuals King Lot had personal success against Sir Meliot de la Roche and against Sir Clariance He was unhorsed by Kay and horsed again only to be wounded in the shoulder by Arthur himself   who was everywhere youthful triumphant over excited As a general Lot seems to have been a martinet and something of a coward But he was a tactician in spite of his formality He seems to have recognized by noon that he was faced by a new kind of warfare which required a new defence The demons of Arthurs cavalry were not concerned with ransoms it was now seen and they were prepared to go on smashing their heads against the wall of his cavalry until it broke He decided to wear them out At a hurried council of war behind the line it was arranged that he himself with four other kings and half the defenders should retire along the glade to prepare a position The remaining six kings were sufficient to hold the English while Lots men rested and re formed Then when the position was prepared the six kings of the advance guard were to retire through it leaving Lot in the front line while they reformed  The army split accordingly  Arthur accepted this moment of division as the opportunity for which he had been waiting He sent an equerry to gallop for the trees He had made a pact of mutual aid with two French kings called Ban and Bors  and these two allies had come from France with about ten thousand men to lend him aid The Frenchmen had been hidden in the forest on either side of the clearing as reserves It had been in their direction that the King had tried to drive the enemy The equerry galloped there was a twinkle of armour among the leafy oaks and Lots mind jumped to the trap He looked only to the one side of the glade where Bors was issuing already upon his flank being unaware at present that Ban was on the other wing  Lots nerve began to collapse at this stage He was wounded in the shoulder faced by an enemy who seemed to accept the death of gentlemen as a part of warfare and now he was in an ambush Oh defend us from death and horrible maims he is reported to have said for I see well we be in great peril of death  He detached King Carados with a strong squadron to meet King Bors only to find that a second equerry had sprung King Ban from the opposite side of him He was still in numerical superiority but his nerve was now gone for good Ha he said to die Duke of Cambenet we must be discomfited He is even supposed to have wept for pity and dole  Carados was personally unhorsed and his squadron broken by King Bors The advance guard of six kings was driven in by Arthurs charges Lot with King Morganores division faced about in order to hold King Ban upon his wing  The rebellion would have been ended on that day with one more hour of daylight But the sun set coming to the rescue of the Old Ones and there was no moon for that quarter Arthur called off the hunt judged accurately that the insurgents were demoralized and allowed his men to sleep in comfort on their arms with few but careful sentries  The exhausted army of his enemies who had diced the night before now spent the hours of darkness sleepless again standing to arms or in their councils Like all the highland armies that have ever marched against Gramarye they were distrustful of each other They expected another night attack They were dismayed by what they had suffered They were divided on the subject of capitulation or resistance It was the brink of daylight before King Lot could have his way  The remaining infantry by his orders were to be turned off like so many cattle to stray and save their naked legs however they could The knights were to band thelmselves into a single phalanx to resist the charges and any man who ran away thereafter was to be shot at once for cowardice  In the morning almost before they were formed Arthur was on them In conformity with his own tactics he sent only a small troop of forty spears to start the work These men a picked striking force of gallants resumed the onslaughts of the previous afternoon They came down at a hand gallop smashed through the rank or broke it reformed and came again The dogged regiment withdrew before them sullen dispirited the fight knocked out of it  At noon the three kings of the allies struck with their full force in a final blow There was the moment of intermingling with a noise like thunder the spectacle of broken lances sailing in the air while horses pawed that element before they went down backward There was a yell that shook the forest After it on the trodden turf with its hoof marks and kicked sods and a debris of offensive weapons there was an unnatural silence There were people riding about aimlessly at a walk But there were no longer any organized traces of the chivalry of the Gael  Merlyn met the King as he rode back from Sorhaute  a magician rather tired and still unmounted He was dressed in the infantry habergeon in which he had insisted on fighting He brought the news that the clans on foot had offered then: capitulation  13 In the September moonlight several weeks later King Pellinore was sitting on the cliff top with his fiancee staring out to sea Soon they were setting off for England to be married His arm was about her waist and his ear was pressed to the top of her head They were unconscious of the world  But Dornar is such a funny name the King was saying I cant think how you thought of it  But you thought of it Pellinore  Did I  Yes Aglovale Percivale Lamorak and Dornar  They will be like cherubs said the King fervently Like cherubim What are cherubim  Behind them the ancient castle loomed against the stars There was a faint noise of shouting from the top of the Round Tower where Grummore and Palomides were arguing with the Questing Beast She was still in love with her counterfeit and still kept the castle in a state of siege   which had only been broken for a few hours on the day of Lots return with his defeated army It had been a surprise for the English knights to learn that they had been at war with Orkney all the time but it was too late to do anything about it since the war was over Now everybody was inside the drawbridge was permanently up and Glatisant lay in the moonlight at the foot of the tower her head gleaming like silver Pellinore had refused to have her killed  Merlyn arrived one afternoon in the course of his northern walking tour wearing a haversack and a pair of monstrous boots He was sleek and snowy and shining like an eel preparing for its nuptial journey to the Sargasso Sea for the time of Nimue was at hand But he was absent  minded unable to remember the one thing which he ought to have told his pupil and he listened to their difficulties with an impatient ear  Excuse me they shouted from the top of the wall as the magician stood outside but its about the Questin Beast The Queen of Lothian and Orkney is in a frightful temper about her  Are you sure it is about the Beast  Certain my dear fellow You see she has us besieged  We dressed up bawled Sir Palomides miserably as a sort of Beast ourselves respected sir and she saw us coming into the castle There are signs ahem of ardent affection Now this creature will not go away because she believes her mate to be inside and it is of a great unsafety to lower the drawbridge  You had better explain to her Stand on the battlements and explain the mistake  Do you think she will understand  After all the magician said she is a magic beast It seems possible  But the explanation was a failure  she looked at them as if she thought they were lying  I say Merlyn Dont go yet  I have to go he said absently I have to do something somewhere but I cant remember what it is Meanwhile I shall have to carry on with my walking tour I am to meet my master Bleise in North Humberland so that he can write down the chronicles of the battle and then we are to have a little wild goose watching and after that  well I cant remember  But Merlyn the Beast would not believe  Never mind His voice was vague and troubled Cant stop Sorry Apologize to Queen Morgause for me will you and say I was asking after her health  He began to revolve on his toes preparatory to vanishing Not much of his walking tour was done on foot  Merlyn Merlyn Wait a bitl  He reappeared for a moment saying in a cross voice:  Well what is it  The Beast will not believe us What are we to do He frowned  Psycho analyse her he said eventually beginning to spin  But Merlyn wait How are we to do this thing The usual method But what is it they cried in despair He disappeared completely his voice remaining in the air  Just find out what her dreams are and so on Explain the facts of life But not too much of Freud  After that as a background to the felicity of King Pellinore  who refused to bother with trivial problems  Grummore and Palomides had to do their best  Well you see Sir Grummore was shouting when a hen lays an egg  Sir Palomides interrupted with an explanation about pollen and stamens  Inside the castle in the royal chamber of the Pele Tower King Lot and his consort were laid in the double bed The king was asleep exhausted by the effort of writing his memoirs about the war He had no particular reason for staying awake Morgause was sleepless  Tomorrow she was going to Carlion for Pellinores wedding She was going as she had explained to her husband in manner of a messenger to plead for his pardon She was taking the children with her  Lot was angry about the journey and wished to forbid it but she knew how to deal with that  The Queen drew herself silently out of bed and went to her coffer She had been told about Arthur since the army returned  about his strength charm innocence and generosity His splendour had been obvious even through the envy and suspicion of those he had conquered Also there had been talk about a girl called Lionore the daughter of the Earl of Sanam with  whom the young man was supposed to be having an affair The Queen opened the coffer in the darkness and stood near the moonlit patch from the window holding a strip of something in her hands It was like a tape  The strip was a less cruel piece of magic than the black cat had been but more gruesome It was called the Spancel  after the rope with which domestic animals were hobbled  and there were several of them in the secret coffers of the Old Ones They were a piseog rather than a great magic  Morgause had got it from the body of a soldier which had been brought home by her husband for burial in the Out Isles  It was a tape of human skin cut from the silhouette of the dead man That is to say the cut had been begun at the right shoulder and the knife  going carefully in a double slit so as to make a tape  had gone down the outside of the right arm round the outer edge of each finger as if along the seams of a glove and up on the inside of the arm to the arm pit Then it had gone down the side of the body down the leg and up it to the crotch and so on until it had completed the circuit of the corpses outline at the shoulder from which it had started It made a long ribbon  The way to use a Spancel was this You had to find the man you loved while he was asleep Then you had to throw it over his head without waking him and tie it in a bow If he woke while you were doing this he would be dead within the year If he did not wake until the operation was over he would be bound to fall in love with you  Queen Morgause stood in the moonlight drawing the Spancel through her fingers  The four children were awake too but they were not in their bedroom They had listened on the stairs during the royal dinner so they knew that they were off to England with their mother  They were in the tiny Church of the Men  a chapel as ancient as Christianity in the islands though it was scarcely twenty feet square It was built of unmortared stones like the great wall of the keep and the moonlight came through its single unglazed window to fall on the stone altar The basin for holy water on which the moonlight fell was scooped out of the living stone and it had a stone lid cut from a flake to match it  The Orkney children were kneeling in the home of their ancestors They were praying that they might be true to their loving mother  that they might be worthy of the Cornwall feud which she had taught them  and that they might never forget the misty land of Lothian where their fathers reigned  Outside the window the thin moon stood upright in a deep sky like the paring of a finger nail for magic and against the sky the weather vane of the carrion crow with arrow in mouth pointed its arrow to the south  14  Fortunately for Sir Palomldes and Sir Grummore the Questing Beast saw reason at the last moment before the cavalcade set out  otherwise they would have had to stay in Orkney and miss the marriage altogether Even as it was they had to stay up all night She recovered quite suddenly  The drawback was that she transferred her affection to the successful analyst  to Palomides  as so often happens in psycho analysis  and now she refused to take any further interest in her early master King Pellinore not without a few sighs for the good old days was forced to resign his rights in her to the Saracen This is why although Malory clearly tells us that only a Pellinore could catch her we always find her being pursued by Sir Palomides in the later parts of the Morte dArthur In any case it makes very little difference who could catch her because nobody ever did  The long march southward toward Carlion with litters swaying and the mounted escort jogging under flapping pennoncells was exciting for everybody The litters thelmselves were interesting They consisted of ordinary carts with a kind of flag staff at each end Between the staffs a hammock was slung in which the jolts were hardly felt The two knights rode behind the royal conveyances delighted at being able to get out of the castle and see the marriage after all St Toirdealbhach followed with Mother Morlan so that it would be a double wedding The Questing Beast brought up the rear keeping a tight eye on Palomides for fear of being let down once again  All the saints came out of then: beehives to see them off All the Fomorians Fir Bolg Tuatha de Danaan Old People and others waved to them without the least suspicion from cliffs currachs mountains bogs and shell mounds All the red deer and unicorns lined the high tops to bid good bye The terns came with their forked tails from the estuary squeaking away as if intent upon imitating an embarkation scene on the wireless  the white bottomed wheatears and pipits flitted along beside them from whin to whin  the eagles peregrines ravens and chuffs made circles over them in the air   the peat smoke followed them as if anxious to make one last curl in the tips of their nostrils  the ogham stones and souterrains and promontory forts exhibited their prehistoric masonry in a blaze of sunlight  the sea trout and salmon put their gleaming heads out of the water  the glens mountains and heather  shoulders of the most beautiful country in the world joined the general chorus  and the soul of the Gaelic world said to the boys in the loudest of fairy voices: Remember Us  If the march was exciting for the children the metropolitan glories of Carlion were enough to take their breath away Here round the Kings castle there were streets  not just one street   and castles of dependent barons and monasteries chapels churches cathedrals markets merchants houses There were hundreds of people in the streets all dressed in blue or red or green or any bright colour with shopping baskets over their arms or driving hissing geese before them or hurrying hither and thither in the livery of some great lord There were bells ringing clocks smiting in belfries standards floating  until the whole air above them seemed to be alive There were dogs and donkeys and palfreys in caparison and priests and farm wagons  whose wheels creaked like the day of judgment  and booths which sold gilt gingerbread and shops where the finest bits of armour in the very latest fashions were displayed There were silk merchants and spice merchants and jewellers The shops had painted trade signs hung over them like the inn signs which we have today There were servitors carousing outside wine shops and old ladies haggling over eggs and itinerant cads carrying cadges of hawks for sale and portly aldermen with gold chains and brown ploughmen with hardly any clothes on except a few bits of leather and leashes of  greyhounds and strange Eastern men selling parrots and pretty ladies mincing along in high dunces caps with veils floating from the top of them and perhaps a page in front of the lady carrying a prayer book if she was going to church  Carlion was a walled town so that this excitement was surrounded by a battlement which seemed to go on for ever and ever The wall had towers every two hundred yards and four great gates as well When you were approaching the town from across the plain you could see the castle keeps and church spires springing out of the wall in a clump   like flowers growing in a pot  King Arthur was delighted to see his old triends again and to hear of Pellinores engagement He was the first knight he had taken a fancy to when he was a small boy in the Forest Sauvage and he decided to give the dear fellow a marriage of unexampled splendour The cathedral of Carlion was booked for it and no trouble was spared that a good time should be had by all The pontifical nuptial high mass was celebrated by such a galaxy of cardinals and bishops and nuncios that there seemed to be no part of the immense church which was not teeming with violet and scarlet and incense and little boys ringing silver bells Sometimes a boy would rush at a bishop and ring a bell at him Sometimes a nuncio would pounce on a cardinal and cense him all over It was like a battle of flowers Thousands of candles blazed before the gorgeous altars In every direction the blunt accustomed holy fingers were spreading little tablecloths or holding up books or blessing each other thoroughly or soaking each other with Holy Water or reverently displaying God to the people The music was heavenly both Gregorian and Ambrosian and the church was packed There were monks and friars and abbots of every description standing about in sandals among the knights whose armour flashed by candlelight There was even a Franciscan bishop wearing grey with a red hat The copes and mitres were almost all of solid gold cloth crusted with diamonds and there was such a putting of them on and taking of them off that the whole cathedral rustled As for the Latin it was talked at such a speed that the rafters rang with genitive plurals  and there was such a prelatical issuing of admonitions exhortations and benedictions that it was a wonder the whole congregation did not go to heaven on the spot Even the Pope who was as keen as anybody that the thing should go with a swing had kindly sent a number of indulgences for everybody he could think of  After the marriage came the wedding feast King Pellinore and his Queen  who had stood hand in hand throughout the previous ceremony with St Toirdealbhach and Mother Morlan behind them quite dazzled with candlelight and incense and aspersion  were propped up in the place of honour and served by Arthur himself on bended knee You can imagine how charmed Mother Morlan was There was peacock pie jellied eels Devonshire cream curried porpoise iced fruit salad and two thousand side dishes There were speeches songs healths and bumpers A special courier arrived at full speed from North Humberland and delivered a message to the bridegroom He said Best Wishes from Merlyn stop The present is under the throne Stop Love to Aglovale Percivale Lamorak Dornar  When the excitement over the message had died down and the wedding present had been found some round games were immediately arranged for the younger members of the party In these a small page of the Kings household excelled He was a son of Arthurs ally at Bedegraine   King Ban of Benwick  and his name was Lancelot There was bobbing for apples shovelboard titter totter and a puppet or motion play called Mac and the Shepherds which made everybody laugh St Toirdealbhach disgraced himself by stunning one of the fatter bishops with his shillelagh during an argument about the Bull called Laudabiliter  Finally at a late hour the party broke up after a feeling rendering of Auld Lang Syne King Pellinore was sick and the new Queen Pellinore put him to bed explaining that he was over  excited  Far away in North Humberland Merlyn jumped out of bed They had been out at dawn and sunset to watch the geese and he had gone to his rest very tired But suddenly he had remembered it in his sleep  the simplest thing It was Arthurs mothers name which he had forgotten to mention in the confusion There he had been chattering away about Uther Pendragon and Round Tables and battles and Guenever and sword sheaths and things past and things to come  but he had forgotten the most important thing of all  Arthurs mother was Igraine  that very Igraine who had been captured at Tintagil the one that the Orkney children had been talking about in the Round Tower at the beginning of this book Arthur had been begotten on the night when Uther Pendragon burst into her castle Since Uther naturally could not marry her until she was out of mourning for the earl the boy had been born too soon That was why Arthur had been sent away to be brought up by Sir Ector Not a soul had known where he was sent except for Merlyn and Uther   and now Uther was dead Even Igraine had not known Merlyn stood swaying in his bare feet on the cold floor If only he had spun himself to Carlion at once before it was too late But the old man was tired and muddled with his backsight and dreams were in his noddle He thought it would do in the morning  could not remember whether he was in the future or the past He put the veined hand blindly toward the bedclothes the image of Nimue already weaving itself in his sleepy brain He tumbled in The beard went under the covering the nose into the pillow Merlyn was asleep  King Arthur sat back in the Great Hall which was empty A few of his favourite knights had been taking their nightcap with him but now he was alone It bad been a tiring day although he had reached the full strength of his youth and he leaned his head against the back of his throne thinking about the events of the marriage He had been fighting on and off ever since he had come to be King by drawing the sword out of the stone and the anxiety of these campaigns had grown him into a splendid fellow At last it looked as if he might have peace He thought of the joys of peace of being married himself one day as Merlyn had prophesied and of having a home He thought of Nimue at this and then of any beautiful woman He fell asleep  He woke with a start to find a black haired blue eyed beauty in front of him who was wearing a crown The four wild children from the north were standing behind their mother shy and defiant and she was folding up a tape  Queen Morgause of the Out Isles had stayed away from the feasting on purpose  had chosen her moment with the utmost care This was the first time that the young King had seen her and she knew that she was looking her best  It is impossible to explain how these things happen Perhaps the Spancel had a strength in it Perhaps it was because she was twice his age so that she had twice the power of his weapons Perhaps it was because Arthur was always a simple fellow who took people at their own valuation easily Perhaps it was because he had never known a mother of his own so that the role of mother love as she stood with her children behind her took him between wind and water  Whatever the explanation may have been the Queen of Air and Darkness had a baby by her half brother nine months later It was called Mordred And this as Merlyn drew it later was what the magician called its pied de grue:  Even if you have to read it twice like something in a history lesson this pedigree is a vital part of the tragedy of King Arthur It is why Sir Thomas Malory called his very long book the Death of Arthur Although nine tenths of the story seems to be about knights jousting and quests for the holy grail and things of that sort the narrative is a whole and it deals with the reasons why the young man came to grief at the end It is the tragedy the Aristotelian and comprehensive tragedy of sin coming home to roost That is why we have to take note of the parentage of Arthurs son Mordred and to remember when the time comes that the king had slept with his own sister He did not know he was doing so and perhaps it may have been due to her but it seems in tragedy that innocence is not enough  Incipit Liber Tertius  THE ILL MADE KNIGHT Nay said Sir Lancelot  for once shamed may never be recovered  1 In the castle of Benwick the French boy was looking at his face in the polished surface of a kettle hat It flashed in the sunlight with the stubborn gleam of metal It was practically the same as the steel helmet which soldiers still wear and it did not make a good mirror but it was the best he could get He turned the hat in various directions hoping to get an average idea of his face from the different distortions which the bulges made He was trying to find out what he was and he was afraid of what he would find  The boy thought that there was something wrong with him All through his life   even when he was a great man with the world at his feet  he was to feel this gap: something at the bottom of his heart of which he was aware and ashamed but which he did not understand There is no need for us to try to understand it We do not have to dabble in a place which he preferred to keep secret  The Armoury where the boy stood was lined with weapons of war For the last two hours he had been whirling a pair of dumb bells in the air  he called them poises  and singing to himself a song with no words and no tune He was fifteen He had just come back from England where his father King Ban of Benwick had been helping the English King to quell a rebellion You remember that Arthur wanted to catch his knights young to train them for the Round Table and that he had noticed Lancelot at the feast because he was winning most of the games  Lancelot swinging his dumb bells fiercely and making his wordless noise had been thinking of King Arthur with all his might He was in love with him That was why he had been swinging the poises He had been remembering all the words of the only conversation which he had held with his hero  The King had called him over when they were embarking for France  after he had kissed King Ban good bye   and they had gone alone into a corner of the ship The heraldic sails of Bans fleet and the sailors in the rigging and the armed turrets and archers and seagulls like flake white had been a background to their conversation  Lance the King had said come here a moment will you  Sir  I was watching you playing games at the feast  Sir  You seemed to win most of them  Lancelot squinted down his nose  I want to get hold of a lot of people who are good at games to help with an idea I have It is for the time when I am a real King and have got this kingdom settled I was wondering whether you would care to help when you are old enough  The boy had made a sort of wriggle and had suddenly flashed his eyes at the speaker  It is about knights Arthur had continued I want to have an Order of Chivalry like the Order of the Garter which goes about fighting against Might Would you like to be one of those  Yes  The King had looked at him closely unable to see whether he was pleased or frightened or merely being polite  Do you understand what I am talking about  Lancelot had taken the wind out of his sails  We call it Fort Mayne in France he had explained The man with the strongest arm in a clan gets made the head of it and does what he pleases That is why we call it Fort Mayne You want to put an end to the Strong Arm by having a band of knights who believe in justice rather than strength Yes I would like to be one of those very much I must grow up first Thank you Now I must say good bye  So they had sailed away from England  the boy standing in the front of the ship and refusing to look back because he did not want to show his feelings He had already fallen in love with Arthur on the night of the wedding feast and he carried with him in his heart to France the picture of that bright northern king at supper flushed and glorious tram his wars  Behind the black eyes which were searching intently in the kettle hat there was a dream which had come to him the previous night Seven hundred years ago  or it may have been fifteen hundred according to Malorys notation  people took dreams as seriously as the psychiatrists do today and Lancelots had been a disturbing one It was not disturbing because of anything it might mean  for he had not the least idea of its meaning  but because it had left him with a sense of loss This was what it was  Lancelot and his young brother Ector Demaris had been sitting in two chairs They got out of these chairs and were mounted on two horses Lancelot said: Go we and seek that which we shall not find So they did But a Man or a Power set upon Lancelot and beat him and despoiled him and clothed him in another array which was full of knots and made him ride on an ass instead of on the horse Then there was a beautiful well with the fairest waters he had ever seen and he got off his ass to drink out of it It seemed to him that there could be nothing in the world more beautiful than to drink of this well But as soon as he stooped his lips toward it the water sank away It went right down into the barrel of the well sinking and  sinking from him so that he could not get it It made him feel desolate to be abandoned by the water of the well  Arthur and the well and the dumb bells which were to make him worthy of Arthur and the ache in his tired arms from swinging them  all these were at the back of the boys mind as he tilted the tin hat backward and forward between his fingers but there was a more insistent thought in his head also It was a thought about the face in the metal and about the thing which must have gone wrong in the depths of his spirit to make a face like that He was not a self deceiver He knew that whichever way he turned the morion it would tell him the same story He had already decided that when he was a grown knight he would give himself a melancholy title He was the eldest son so he was bound to be knighted but he would not call himself Sir Lancelot He would call himself the Chevalier Mai Fet   the Ill Made Knight  So far as he could see  and he felt that there must be some reason for it somewhere  the boys face was as ugly as a monsters in the Kings menagerie He looked like an African ape  2 Lancelot ended by being the greatest knight King Arthur had He was a sort of Bradman top of the battling averages Tristram and Lamorak were second and third  But you have to remember that people cant be good at cricket unless they teach themselves to be so and that jousting was an art just as cricket is It was like cricket in many ways There was a scorers pavilion at a tournament with a real scorer inside it who made marks on the parchment just like the mark for one run which is made by the cricket scorer today The people walking round the ground in their best frocks from Grand Stand to Refreshment Tent must have found the fighting very like the game It took a frightfully long time  Sir Lancelots innings frequently lasted all day if he were battling against a good knight  and the movements had a feeling of slow motion because of the weight of armour When the sword play had begun the combatants stood opposite each other in the green acre like batsman and bowler  except that they stood closer together  and perhaps Sir Gawaine would start with an in swinger which Sir Lancelot would put away to leg with a beautiful leg glide and then Lancelot would reply with a yorker under Gawaines guard  it was called foining   and all the people round the field would clap King Arthur might turn to Guenever in the Pavilion and remark that the great mans footwork was as lovely as ever The knights had little curtains on the back of their helms to keep the hot sun off the metal like the handkerchief which cricketers will sometimes arrange behind their caps today  Knightly exercise was as much an art as cricket is and perhaps the only way in which Lancelot did not resemble Bradman was that he was more graceful He did not have that crouching on the bat and hopping out to the pitch of the ball He was more like Woolley But you cant be like Woolley by simply sitting still and wanting to be so  The Armoury where the small boy who was later to be Sir Lancelot was standing with his morion was the largest single room in the castle of Benwick It was to be the room in which this boy was to spend most of his waking hours for the next three years  The rooms of the main castle  which he could see from the windows  were mostly small because people cant afford to build for luxury when they are making a fortification Round the inner fort with its small rooms there was a wide byre or shell keep into which the castle herds were driven during a siege This was surrounded by a high wall with towers and on the inner side of this wall the big rooms which were needed for stores barns barracks and stables were built The Armoury was one of these rooms It stood between the stables for fifty horses and the cowsheds The best family armour  the bits which were actually in use   was kept in a little room in the castle itself and it was only the arms of the troops and the spare parts of the family stuff and the things which were needed for gymnastics practice or physical training which reposed in the Armoury  Under the raftered ceiling and the nearest to it there hung or leaned a collection of bannerettes and pennoncels blazoned with the Ban charges  France Ancient as they are now called  which would be needed on various occasions Along the wall there were tilting lances resting horizontally on nails so that they should not warp These looked like bars for exercises in a gymnasium In one corner a collection of old lances which had already warped or got injured in some way but which might still be useful for something were standing upright A rack running the whole length of the second main wall held the infantry issue of mail habergeons with mittens spears morions and Bordeaux swords King Ban was fortunate in living at Benwick for the Bordeaux swords were local and particularly good Then there were harness barrels in which the armour was packed in hay for expeditions overseas  some of it was still packed from the last expedition and a curious mixture it was Uncle Dap who looked after the Armoury had been unpacking one of the barrels to make an inventory of its contents  and had gone away in despair on discovering ten pounds of dates and five loaves of sugar in it It must have been some sort of honey sugar unless it was loaf sugar brought back from the Crusades He had left his list beside the barrel and this recorded among other articles: a salade garnessed with golde iij peire gantelez a vestment a mesbooke an auter cloth a peir of brigandines a pyssying basin of silver x schertes for my Lord a jakete of leather and a bagge of chessmen Then in an alcove formed by the harness  barrels there was a set of shelves which formed the dispensary for sick armour On the shelves there were huge bottles of olive oil  nowadays they prefer a mineral oil for armour but they did not understand such niceties in Lancelots time  together with boxes of fine sand for polishing bags of brigandine nails at eleven shillings and eightpence the twenty thousand rivets spare rings for chain mail leather skins for cutting new straps and bases for the knee harness together with a thousand other details then fascinating but now lost to us There were gambesons like the pads which the goalkeeper wears in hockey or like the quilted protections which Americans have at football In various corners there were pushed so as to leave a free space in the middle of the room a collection of gymnastic apparatus such as quintains and so on while Uncle Daps desk stood near the door On the desk there were splattering quill pens blotting sand sticks for beating Lancelot when he was stupid and notes in unutterable confusion as to which jupons had lately been pawned  pawning was a great institution for valuable armour  and which helms had been brought up to date with a glancing surface and whose vambrace stood in need of repair and what had been paid to whom for fforbeshynge which when Most of the accounts were wrongly added up  Three years may seem a long time for a boy to spend in one room if he only goes out of it to eat and sleep and to practise tilting in the field It is even difficult to imagine a boy who would do it unless you realize from the start that Lancelot was not romantic and debonair Tennyson and the Pre Raphaelites would have found it difficult to recognize this rather sullen and unsatisfactory child with the ugly face who did not disclose to anybody that he was  living on dreams and prayers They might have wondered what store of ferocity he had against himself that could set him to break his own body so young They might have wondered why he was so strange  To begin with he had to spend the weary months charging against Uncle Dap with a blunt spear under his arm Uncle Dap armed cap � pie would sit on a stool  and Lancelot with the morne headed spear would charge and charge against him learning the best lodges on armour for a point Then there were lonely hours with poises with many other hours out of doors  before he was even allowed to touch real arms  in which he learned various kinds of throwing casting with the sling stick or the casting spear and tossing the bar After that after a year of toil there was his promotion to the pel quintain It was a stake driven upright in the ground and he had to fight against it with sword and shield  rather like shadow boxing or using a punch ball He had to use arms for this exercise which weighed twice as much as the ordinary sword and shield Sixty pounds was considered a good weight for the arms used on the pel quintain  so that when he did come at length to the usual weapons he would wield them featly They would seem light by comparison The final stage of breaking to the cricket standard was by mock combats In these at last and after all the bitter setbacks of discipline he was allowed to fight battles which were nearly real ones against his brother and cousins The combats were held under strict rules They might begin with a cast of the spear blunted followed by seven strokes with the sword point and edge rebated without close or griping one another with the handes upon paine of punishment as the judges for the time being shall thinke requisite It was not lawful in these matches to foin  that is to make a thrust of the point Finally there was swashbuckling The now vigorous boy might go at his companions harum scarum with sword and buckler  If you have been down in one of the old fashioned diving suits which used to be standard in the Royal Navy before frogmen and free diving came along you will know why divers move slowly A diver has forty pounds of lead on each foot and two plaques of lead  each weighing fifty pounds  one on his back and one on his chest These are apart from the weight of the suit and the helmet Except when he is in the sea he weighs twice as much as a man When he has to step over a rope or an air tube on deck it is hard work  like climbing a wall If you push him from in front the weight behind him tends to take over so that he might fall backwards The same thing happens vice versa Practised divers become adept at dealing with these handicaps and can hoist those forty pound feet up and down the ships ladder fairly nimbly  but an amateur half kills himself with the mere toil of movement Lancelot like the diver had to learn to be nimble against the force of gravity  Knights in armour were like divers in more ways than one  Apart from their helmets and encumbrances and the difficulty of breathing they had to be dressed in their suits by kind and careful assistants They had to rely on these assistants to do it properly A diver puts his life in the hands of the ratings who are dressing him These young men like pages or squires mother him with great tenderness and concentration and with a sort of protective respect They always address him by his title not by bis name They say Sit down diver or Now the left foot diver or Diver Two can you hear me on the inter com  It is good to put your life in other peoples hands  Three years of it The other boys did not worry for they had other things to think about  but for the ugly one it was the whole of an obscure and mystic life He had to perfect himself for Arthur as somebody who was good at games and he had to think about the theories of chivalry even when he was in bed at night He had to teach himself to possess a sound opinion on hundreds of disputed points   on the proper length of weapons or the cut of a mantling or the articulation of a pauldron or whether cedarwood was better than ash for spears as Chaucer seems to have believed  Here ia a short example of the problems of chivalry which he thought about in his early times There was a knight once called Reynaud de Roy who had a tilting match with another one called John de Holland Reynaud purposely fastened his tilting helm  the huge straw  padded drum which sometimes fitted over the helmet proper  so that it was loose When John of Hollands spear point struck it it simply fell off This meant that the helm came off Reynaud instead of Reynaud coming off his horse An effective trick but a dangerous one   the whole of chivalry argued about it for a long time some saying that it was unsporting some that it was fair but too risky and some that it was a good idea  Three years of discipline made Lancelot not a merry heart and a capacity for singing tirra  lirra Out of a lifetime which at his age must have seemed to stretch little more than a week ahead he gave thirty six months to another mans idea because he was in love with it He supported himself meanwhile on daydreams He wanted to be the best knight in the world so that Arthur would love him in return and he wanted one other thing which was still possible in those days He wanted through his purity and excellence to be able to perform some ordinary miracle  to heal a blind man or something like that for instance  3 There was a feature about the great families which centred round the doom of Arthur All three had a resident genius of the family half way between a tutor and a confidant who affected the characters of the children in each At Sir Ectors castle there had been Merlyn who was the main influence in Arthurs life In lonely and distant Lothian there had been St Toirdealbhach whose warlike philosophy must have had something to do with the clannishness of Gawaine and his brothers In King Bans castle there was an uncle of Lancelots whose name was Gwenbors Actually he was the old man we have met known to everybody as Uncle Dap but his given name was Gwenbors In those days you generally named your children in the same way as we name foxhounds and foals today If you happened to be Queen Morgause and had four children you put a G in all their names (Gawaine Agravaine Gaheris and Gareth)   and naturally if your brothers happened to be called Ban and Bors you were doomed to be called Gwenbors yourself It made it easier to remember who you were  Uncle Dap was the only one in the family who took Lancelot seriously and Lancelot was the one who was serious about Uncle Dap It was easy not to be serious about the old fellow for he was that peculiar creation which ignorant people laugh at  a genuine maestro His branch of learning was chivalry There was not a piece of armour proofed in Europe but what Uncle Dap had a theory about it He was furious with the new Gothic style with its ridges and scallop patterns and fluting He considered it ridiculous to wear armour like the ropework on a Nelson sideboard for it was obvious that every groove would be liable to hold a point The whole object of good armour he said was to throw the point off  and when he thought of the people in Germany making their horrible furrows he nearly went frantic There was  nothing in Heraldry which he did not know If anybody committed any of the grosser errors   such as putting metal on metal or colour on colour  he became electrified with passion His long white moustaches quivered at their tips like antennae the ends of his fingers came together in gestures of the wildest passion and he waved his arms and jumped up and down and wagged his eyebrows and almost fizzed Nobody can be a maestro without being subject to these excitements so Lancelot seldom minded when he got his face slapped in a melee about shields cut � bouche or about whether it was a good idea to have a guige on your shield or not Sometimes Uncle Dap was tantalized into beating him but he bore that also In those days they did  One reason for not minding Uncle Daps transports was that everything the boy wanted could be learned from him He was not only a distinguished clerk and authority on his own subjects  he was also one of the finest swordsmen in France It was for this really that the boy had attached himself It was in order to rase and trace and foin under the brutal tuition of genius  in order to hold out a heavy sword at arms length in a lunge until he felt he would split in half only to have Uncle Dap catch hold of his point and pull him into a crueler stretch  Ever since he could remember there had been the excited man with the eyes of blue steel jumping up and down and snapping his fingers and shouting out as if life itself depended on it: Doublez Dedoublez D�gagez Un Deux  One fine day in late summer Lancelot was sitting in the Armoury with his uncle In the big room there was a lot of dust dancing in the sunbeams dust which they had thelmselves been stirring up a moment before and round the walls there were the ranks of polished armour and the rack of spears and helms and morions hanging on pegs There were misericordes and harness and the various banners and pennoncels blazoned with the Ban chargers The two fencers had sat down to rest after an exciting bout and Uncle Dap was blown Lancelot was eighteen now He was a better fencer than his maestro  though Uncle Dap would not admit it and his pupil tactfully pretended that he was not  A page came in while they were still panting and told him that he was wanted by his mother Why  The page said that a gentleman had arrived who wanted to see him and the Queen had said that he was to come at once  Queen Elaine was sitting in the solar where she had been doing tapestry work and her two guests were sitting on either side of her She was not the Elaine who had been one of the Cornwall sisters It was a popular name in those days and several women ini the Morte dArthur had it particularly as some of its manuscript sources have got mixed up The three grown ups at the long table looked like a row of examiners in the dim room One of the guests was an elderly gentleman with a white beard and pointed hat and the other was a handsome minx with an olive complexion and plucked eyebrows They all three looked at Lancelot and the old gentleman spoke first Hum They waited  You called him Galahad said the old gentleman His first name Was Galahad he added and now he is Lancelot since he was confirmed However did you know  It cant be helped said Merlyn It is one of the things one does know and theres an end ont Now let me see what are the other things I was supposed to tell you  The young lady with the plucked eyebrows put her hand before her mouth and yawned gracefully like a cat  He will get the hope of his heart thirty years from now and he will be the best knight in the world Shall I live to see it asked Queen Elaine Merlyn scratched his head gave it a bump on the top with his knuckles and replied: Yes  Well  said the Queen it is all very wonderful I must say Do you hear that Lance You are to be the best knight in the world  The boy asked: Have you come from the court of King Arthur  Yes  Is everything well  Yes He sent you his love  Is the King happy  Very happy Guenever sent her love too  Who is Guenever  Good gracious exclaimed the magician Didnt you know about that No of course not I have been getting be jingled in my brains  Here he glanced at the beautiful lady as if she might be responsible for the jingling  which she was She was Nimue and he had fallen in love with her at last  Guenever said Nimue is Arthurs new queen They have been married for some time  Her father is King Leodegrance explained Merlyn He gave Arthur a present of a round table when they were married and a hundred knights to go with it There is room at the table for a hundred and fifty  Lancelot said: Oh  The King meant to tell you said Merlyn Perhaps the messenger got drowned on the way over There may have been a storm He really did mean to tell you  Oh said the boy for the second time  Merlyn began to talk quickly because he saw that it was a difficult situation From Lancelots face he could not tell whether he was hurt or whether it was like that always  He has only managed to fill in twenty nine of the seats so far he said There is room for twenty one more Plenty of room All the knights names are written on them in gold  There was a pause during which nobody knew what to say Then Lancelot cleared his throat  There was a boy he said when I was in England His name was Gawaine Has he been made one of the knights of the table  Merlyn looked guilty and nodded his head  He was created on the day Arthur was married  I see  There was another long pause  This lady said Merlyn feeling that he had better fill in the silence is called Nimue I am in love with her We are having a sort of honeymoon together  only it is a magical one  and now we shall have to be off to Cornwall I am sorry we could not visit you for longer  My dear Merlyn exclaimed the Queen but surely you will stay the night  No no Thank you Thank you very much We are in a hurry just now  You will have a glass of something before you leave  No thank you It is very kind of you but really we must be off We have some magic to attend to in Cornwall  Such a short visit   began the Queen  Merlyn cut her short by standing up and taking Nimues hand in his  Good bye now he said with determination  and in a couple of spins they were both gone  Their bodies were gone but the magicians voice remained in the air  Thats that they could hear him saying in a relieved tone Now then my angel what about that place I was telling you of in Cornwall the one with the magical cave in it  Lancelot went back to Uncle Dap in the Armoury with slow steps He stood in front of his uncle and bit his lip  I am going to England he said  Uncle Dap looked at him in amazement but said nothing  I shall start this evening  It seems sudden said Uncle Dap Your mother does not usually make up her mind so quickly  My mother does not know  Do you mean that you are going to run away  If I told my mother and father there would only be a fuss he said It is not that I am running away I shall come back again But I must go to England as quick as I can  Do you expect me not to tell your mother  Yes I do  Uncle Dap gnawed the ends of his moustache and wrung his hands  If they get to know that I could have prevented it he said Ban will cut off my head  They will not know said the boy indifferently and he went away to arrange about his packing  A week later Lancelot and Uncle Dap were sitting in a peculiar boat in the middle of the English Channel The boat had a sort of castle at each end There was another castle half way up the single mast which gave it the appearance of a dovecote It had flags fore and aft The one gay sail had a Cross Potent on it while an enormous streamer floated from the top of the mast There were eight oars and the two passengers were seasick  4 The hero worshipper rode towards Camelot with a bitter heart It was hard for him at eighteen to have given his life to a king only to be forgotten  hard to have spent those sorrowful hours with the heavy arms in the dust of the Armoury only to see Sir Gawaine knighted first  hardest of all to have broken his body for the older mans ideal only to find this mincing wife stepping in at the end of it to snatch away his love at no cost at all Lancelot was jealous of Guenever and he was ashamed of himself for being so  Uncle Dap rode behind the grieving boy in silence He knew a thing which the other was still too green to know   that he had taught the finest knight in Europe Like an excited tit which had nursed a cuckoo Uncle Dap fluttered along behind his prodigy He was carrying the fighting harness which was strapped up in apple pie order according to his own dodges and wrinkles  for from now on he was Lancelots squire  They came to a clearing in the wood and a little stream ran through the middle There was a ford here and the stream ran tinkling over the clean stones only a few inches deep The sun shone down into the clearing Some wood pigeons sang drowsily their Take Two Cows Taffy and on the other side of the musical water there was an enormous knight in black armour with his tilting helm in position He sat motionless on a black charger and his shield was still in its canvas case It was impossible to read his blazon Being so still so portly in his iron sheath and having the great blind helm over his head so that he had no proper face he had a look of danger about him You did not know what he was thinking nor what action he might be going to take He was a menace  Lancelot halted and so did Uncle Dap The black knight walked his horse into the shallow water and drew rein in front of them He raised his lance in a gesture of salute then pointed with it to a place behind Lancelots back Either he was telling him to go home again or else he was pointing out a good position from which they could start their charges Whichever the  case might be Lancelot saluted with his gauntlet and turned round to go to the place He took one of his spears from Uncle Dap pulled his tilting helm round in front of him  it had been hanging behind on a chain  and lifted the steel turret into position on his head He laced it on Now he too had become a man without an expression  The two knights faced each other from opposite ends of the little glade Then although neither of them had so far spoken a word they fewtered their spears put spurs to their horses and began to charge Uncle Dap drawn up safely behind a near by tree could hardly contain his delight He knew what was going to happen to thd black knight although Lancelot did not know and he began to snap his fingers  The first time you do a thing it is often exciting To go alone in an airplane for the first time used to be so exciting that it nearly choked you Lancelot had never ridden a serious joust before  and although he had charged at hundreds of quintains and thousands of rings he had never taken his life in his hands in earnest In the first moment of the charge he felt to himself: Well now I am off Nothing can help me now In the second moment he settled down to behave automatically in the same way as he had always behaved with the quintain and the rings  The point of his spear took the black knight under the rim of his shoulder harness at exactly the right place His mount was in full gallop and the black knights was still in a canter The black knight and his horse revolved rapidly toward their sinister side left the ground together in a handsome parabola and came down again with a clash As Lancelot rode by he could see them sprawling on the ground together with the knights broken lance between the horses legs and one flashing horse shoe tearing the canvas from the fallen shield The man and the horse were mixed together Each was afraid of the other and each was kicking against the other in the effort to be parted Then the horse got up on its forelegs its haunches heaved upright and the knight sat up lifting one steel gauntlet as if to rub his head Lancelot reined in and rode back to him  Generally when one knight had given another a fall with the lance the fallen one used to lose his temper blame the fall on his horse and insist upon fighting it out with swords on foot The usual excuse was to say: The son of a mare hath failed me but I wote well my fathers sword never shalL  The black knight however did not do the usual thing He was evidently a more cheerful kind of person than the colour of his armour would suggest for he sat up and blew through the split of his helm making a note of surprise and admiration Then he took off the helm and mopped his brow The shield whose cover the horses hoof had torn bore or a dragon rampant gules  Lancelot threw his spear into a bush got off his horse very quickly and knelt down beside the knight All his love was back again inside him It was typical of Arthur not to lose his temper typical of him to sit on the ground making noises of admiration when he had just been given a great fall  Sir said Lancelot taking off his own helm with a humble gesture; and he bowed his head in the French fashion  The King began scrambling to his feet in great excitement  Lancelot he exclaimed Why its the boy Lancelot You are the kings son of Benwick I remember seeing you when he came over for the Battle of Bedegraine What a fall I never saw anything like it Where did you learn to do this It was terrificl Were you coming to my Court How is King Ban How is your charming mother Really my dear chap this is magnificent  Lancelot looked up at the breathless King who held out both hands to help him to his feet and his jealousy and grief were over  They caught their horses and jogged off toward the palace side by side forgetting Uncle Dap They had so much to say to each other that they both talked all the time Lancelot gave imaginary messages from King Ban or from Queen Elaine and Arthur talked about how Gawaine had killed a lady He told how King Pellinore had got so courageous since bis marriage that he had killed King Lot of Orkney by mistake in a tournament and how the Round Table was going as well as could be expected but very slowly and how now that Lancelot had arrived everything would come right before they knew where they were  He was knighted the first day  he might have been knighted at any time during the past two years but he had refused to be done by anybody except Arthur  and he was introduced to Guenever the same evening There is a story that her hair was yellow but it was not It was so black that it was startling and her blue eyes deep and clear had a sort of fearlessness which was startling too She was surprised by the young mans twisted face but not frightened  Now said the King putting their hands together This is Lancelot the one I told you about He is going to be the best knight I have I never saw such a fall as he gave me I want you to be kind to him Gwen His father is one of my oldest friends  He kissed the Queens hand coldly  He did not notice anything particular about her because his mind was filled with previous pictures which he had made for himself There was no room for pictures of what she was really like He thought of her only as the person who had robbed him and since robbers are deceitful designing and heartless people he thought of her as these  How do you do asked the Queen  Arthur said: We shall have to tell him what has been happening since he went away What a lot of things to tell Where can we begin  Begin with the Table said Lancelot  Oh dear  The Queen laughed and smiled at the new knight  Arthur thinks about it all the time she said He even dreams about it at night He wont be able to tell you unless he talks for a week  It is not going badly said the King You cant expect a thing like that to go smoothly the whole time The idea is there and people are beginning to understand it and that is the great thing I am sure it will work  What about the Orkney faction  They will come round in time  Is that Gawaine inquired Lancelot What is the matter with the Orkney faction  The King looked uncomfortable He said: The real matter with them is Morgause their mother She brought them up with so little love or security that they find it difficult to understand warm hearted people thelmselves They are suspicious and frightened They dont get hold of the idea as I wanted them to do We have three of them here  Gawaine Gaheris and Agravaine It is not their fault  Arthur had his first Pentecost feast the year we were married explained Guenever and sent everybody out looking for good adventures to see how the idea would work When they came back Gawaine had cut a ladys head off and even dear old Pellinore had failed to rescue a damsel in distress Arthur was furious about it  It is not Gawaines fault said the King He is a nice fellow I like him It is the fault of that woman  I hope things have got better since then  Yes It is slow work of course but I am sure we could say that things have got better  Did Pellinore repent  Arthur said: Pellinore repented yes There was not much to repent It was one of his muddles But the trouble is that he has got so valiant since he married the Queens daughter of Flanders that he has taken to jousting in earnest and quite often wins I was telling you how he killed King Lot one day when they were having a practice It has created a great deal of ill feeling The Orkney children have sworn to revenge their fathers death and they are out on the warpath for poor old PeUinores blood I am having difficulty in making them behave  Lancelot will help you said the Queen It will be nice to have an old friend to help  Yes it will be nice Now Lance I expect you will want to see your room  It was the second half of summer and the amateur falconers in Camelot were bringing their peregrines to the last stages of their training If you are a clever falconer you get your hawk on the wing quickly If you are not you are apt to make mistakes and the result is that the hawk does not finish her training for some time So all the falconers in Camelot were trying to show that they were clever ones   by getting their hawks entered as quickly as possible   and in all directions if you went for a walk in the fields there were atrabilious hawk masters stretching out their creances and quarrelling with their assistants Hawking as James the First pointed out is an extreme stirrer up of passions It is because the hawks thelmselves are furious creatures and the people who associate with them catch it  Arthur presented Sir Lancelot with an inter mewed jerfalcon with which to keep himself amused This was a great compliment for jerfalcons were only supposed to be used by kings At any rate that is what the Abbess Juliana Berners tell us  perhaps incorrectly An emperor was allowed an eagle a king could have a jerfalcon and after that there was the peregrine for an earl the merlin for a lady the goshawk for a yeoman the sparrow hawk for a priest and the musket for a holy water clerk Lancelot was pleased with his present and settled down busily in competition with the other angry falconers who were hard at work criticizing each others methods and sending each other messages of sugary venom and getting yellow about the eyeballs  The jerfalcon which had been given to Lancelot was not properly through her moult Like Hamlet she was fat and scant of breath Her long confinement in the mews while she moulted had got her into a sulky and temperamental state So Lancelot had to fly her on the creance for several days before he could be sure that she was safe to the lure If you have ever flown a hawk on a creance which is a long line tied to the hawks jesses so that she cannot fly away you know what a nuisance the thing can be Nowadays people use a fishing reel which makes it easier to stretch it out and to wind it up  but in Lancelots day there were no good reels and you simply had to wind your creance into a ball like string There were two main horrors to which it was subject the first of which was the horror peculiar to all balls of string  that they invariably became tangles instead of balls The second was that if you flew the hawk in any field which had not been carefully mowed the string became wound round thistles or tufts of grass thus checking the hawk and doing damage to its training So Lancelot and all the other angry men went circling round Camelot in a bitter atmosphere of knots and competition and bating hawks  King Arthur had asked his wife to be kind to the young man She was fond of her husband and she realized that she had come between him and his friend She was not such a fool as to try to atone to Lancelot for this but she had taken a fancy for him as himself She liked his broken face however hideous it was and Arthur had asked her to be kind There was a shortage of assistants in Camelot for the hawking because there were so many people at it So Guen ever began going with Lancelot to help him with the balls of string  He did not take much notice of the woman Here comes that woman he would remark to himself or There goes that woman He was already deep in the hawking atmosphere which was only partly an affair for females and he seldom thought of her more than that He had grown into a beautifully polite youth in spite of his ugliness and he was too self conscious to allow himself to have petty thoughts for long His jealousy had turned into unconsciousness of her existence He went on with his hawk mastery thanking her politely for her help and accepting it with courtesy  One day there was particular trouble with a thistle and he had miscalculated the amount of food which ought to have been given the day before The jerfalcon was in a foul temper and Lancelot caught its mood Guenever who was not particularly good with hawks and had no special interest in them was frightened by his frowning brow and because she was frightened she became clumsy She was sweetly trying her best to help but she knew that she was not clever at falconry and there was confusion in her mind Very carefully and kindly and with the best intentions she wound the creance up quite wrong He took the wretched ball away from her with a gesture which was almost rough  Thats no good he said and he began to unwind her hopeful work with angry fingers His eyebrows made a horrible scowl  There was a moment in which everything stood still Guenever stood hurt in her heart Lancelot sensing her stillness stood also The hawk stopped bating and the leaves did not rustle  The young man knew in this moment that he had hurt a real person of his own age He saw in her eyes that she thought he was hateful and that he had surprised her badly She had been giving kindness and he had returned it with unkindness But the main thing was that she was a real person She was not a minx not deceitful not designing and heartless She was pretty Jenny who could think and feel  5 The first two people to notice that Lancelot and Guenever were falling in love with each other were Uncle Dap and King Arthur himself Arthur had been warned about this by Merlyn   who was now safely locked up in his cave by the fickle Nimue  and he had been fearing it subconsciously But he always hated knowing the future and had managed to dismiss it from his mind Uncle Daps reaction was to give his pupil a lecture as they stood in the mews with the chastened jer  Gods Feet said Uncle Dap with other exclamations of the same kind What is this What are you doing Is the finest knight in Europe to throw away everything I have taught him for the sake of a ladys beautiful eyes And a married lady too  I dont know what you are talking about  Dont know Wont know Holy Mother shouted Uncle Dap Is it Guenever I am talking about or is it not Glory be to God for evermore  Lancelot took the old gentleman by the shoulders and sat him down on a chest  Look Uncle he said with determination I have been wanting to talk to you Isnt it time you went back to Benwick  Benwick cried his uncle as if he had been stabbed to the heart  Yes Benwick You cant go on pretending to be my squire for ever For one thing you are the brother of two kings and for another thing you are three times as old as I am It would be against the laws of arms  Laws of arms shouted the old man Pouf  Well it is no good saying Pouf  And me that has taught you everything you know Me to go back to Benwick without having seen you prove yourself at all Why you have not even used your sword in front of  me not used Joyeux It is ingratitude perfidy treachery Sorrow to the grave My faith By the Blue  And the agitated old fellow went off into a long string of Gallic remarks including the so  called William the Conquerors oath of Per Splendorem Dei and the Pasque Dieu which was the imaginary King Louis the Elevenths idea of a joke Inspired by the royal train of thought he added the exclamations of Rufus Henry the First John and Henry the Third which were in that order By the Holy Face of Lucca By Gods Death By Gods Teeth and By Gods Head The jerfalcon seeming to appreciate the display roused his feathers heartily like a housemaid shaking a mop out of the window  Well if you wont go you wont said Lancelot But please dont talk to me about the Queen I cant help it if we are fond of each other and there is nothing wrong in being fond of people is there It is not as if the Queen and I were villains When you begin lecturing me about her you are making it seem as if there was something wrong between us It is as if you thought ill of me or did not believe in my honour Please do not mention the subject again  Uncle Dap rolled his eyes disarranged his hair cracked his knuckles kissed his finger tips and made other gestures calculated to express his point of view But he did not refer to the love affair afterwards  Arthurs reaction to the problem was complicated Merlyns warning about his lady and his best friend had contained within itself the seeds of its own contradiction for your friend can hardly be your friend if he is also going to be your betrayer Arthur adored his rose petalled Guenever for her dash and had an instinctive respect for Lancelot which was soon to become affection This made it difficult either to suspect them or not to suspect  The conclusion which he came to was that it would be best to solve the problem by taking Lancelot with him to the Roman war That at any rate would separate the boy from Guenever and it would be pleasant to have his disciple with him  a fine soldier  whether Merlyns warning were true or not  The Roman war was a complicated business which had been brewing for years It need not concern us long It was in its way the logical consequence of Bedegraine  the continuation of that battle on a European scale The feudal idea of war for ransom had been squashed in Britain but not abroad and now the foreign ransom hunters were after the newly settled King A gentleman called Lucius who was the Dictator of Rome  and it is strange to reflect that Dictator is the very word which Malory uses  had sent an embassy asking for tribute from Arthur  it was called a tribute before a battle and a ransom afterward  to which the King after consulting his parliament had returned a message that no tribute was due So the Dictator Lucius had declared war He had also sent his messengers like Lars Porsena in Macaulay to all the points of the compass to gather allies He had no less than sixteen kings marching with him from Rome into High Germany on their way to do battle with the English He had allies from Ambage Arrage Alisandrie Inde Hermonie Euphrates Affrike Europe the Large Ertaine Elamie Arabie Egypt Damaske Damiete Cayer Capadoce Tarce Turkey Pounce Pampoille Surrie and Galacie beside others from Greece Cyprus Macedone Calabre Cateland Portingale and many thousands of Spaniards  During the first weeks of Lancelots infatuation for Guenever it became time for Arthur to cross the Channel to meet his enemy in France  and it was on this war that he decided to  carry the young man with him Lancelot of course was not at that time recognized as the chief knight of the Round Table or he would have been taken in any case At the present period of his life he had only fought one joust with Arthur himself and the accepted captain of the knights was Gawaine  Lancelot was angry at being taken from Guenever because he felt that it implied a lack of trust Besides he knew that Sir Tristram had been left with King Marks wife of Cornwall on a similar occasion He did not see why he should not be left with Guenever in the same way  There is no need to go into the whole story of the Roman campaign although it lasted several years It was the usual sort of war with a great deal of shoving and shouting on both sides great strokes smitten many men overthrown and great valiances prowesses and feats of arms shown every day It was Bedegraine enlarged  with the same refusal on Arthurs part to regard it as a sporting or commercial enterprise  although it did have its characteristic touches Redheaded Gawaine lost his temper when sent on an embassy and killed a man in the middle of the negotiations Sir Lancelot led a terrific battle in which his men were outnumbered by three to one He slew the King Lyly and three great lords called Alakuke Herawd and Heringdale During the campaign three notorious giants were accounted for   two of them by Arthur himself Finally in the last engagement Arthur gave the Emperor Lucius such a blow on the head that Excalibur stinted not till it came to his breast and it was discovered that the Sowdan of Surrie and the King of Egypt and the King of Ethiope  an ancestor of Haile Selassie  together with seventeen other kings of diverse regions and sixty senators of Rome were among the slain Arthur put their bodies into sumptuous coffins  not sarcastically  and sent them to the Lord Mayor of Rome instead of the tribute which had been demanded This induced the Lord Mayor and nearly the whole of Europe to accept him as overlord The lands of Pleasance Pavia Petersaint and the Port of Tremble yielded him homage The feudal convention of battle was broken for good on the Continent as well as in England  During this warfare Arthur became genuinely fond of Lancelot and by the time they came home he no longer believed in Merlyns prophecy at all He had put it at the back of his mind Lancelot was acknowledged to be the greatest fighter in the army Both of them were determined that Guenever could not come between them and the first few years were safely past  6 What sort of picture do people have of Sir Lancelot from this end of time Perhaps they only think of him as an ugly young man who was good at games But he was more than this He was a knight with a medieval respect for honour  There is a phrase which you sometimes come across in country districts even nowadays which sums up a good deal of what he might have tried to say Farmers use it in Ireland as praise or compliment saying So and so has a Word He will do what he promised  Lancelot tried to have a Word He considered it as the ignorant country people still consider it to be the most valuable of possessions  But the curious thing was that under the king post of keeping faith with himself and with others he had a contradictory nature which was far from holy His Word was valuable to him not only because he was good but also because he was bad It is the bad people who need to have principles to restrain them For one thing he liked to hurt people It was for the strange reason that he was cruel that the poor fellow never killed a man who asked for mercy or committed a cruel action which he could have prevented One reason why he fell in love with Guenever was because the first thing he had done was to hurt her He might never have noticed her as a person if he had not seen the pain in her eyes  People have odd reasons for ending up as saints A man who was not afflicted by ambitions of decency in his mind might simply have run away with his heros wife and then perhaps the tragedy of Arthur would never have happened An ordinary fellow who did not spend half his life torturing himself by trying to discover what was right so as to conquer his inclination towards what was wrong might have cut the knot which brought their ruin  When the two friends arrived in England from the Roman war the fleet landed at Sandwich It was a grey September day with the blue and copper butterflies flitting in the after grass the partridges calling like crickets the blackberries colouring and the hazel nuts still nursing their tasteless little kernels in cradles of cotton wool Queen Guenever was on the beach to meet them and the first thing Lancelot knew after she had kissed the King was that she was able to come between them after all He made a movement as if his entrails were tying thelmselves in knots saluted the Queen went off to bed in the nearest inn at once and lay awake all night In the morning he asked leave of absence from the court  But you have hardly been at court at all said Arthur Why do you want to go away so soon  I ought to go away  Ought to go away asked the King What do you mean you ought to go away  Lancelot clenched his fist until the knuckles stood out and said I want to go on a quest I want to find an adventure  But Lance    It is what the Round Table is for isnt it shouted the young man The knights are to go on quests arent they to fight against Might What are you trying to stop me for Its the whole point of the idea  Oh come said the King You neednt get excited about it If you want to go of course you can do whatever you like I only thought it would be nice to have you with us for a little Dont be cross Lance I dont know what has come over you  Come back soon said the Queen  7  This was the beginning of the famous quests They were not made to win him fame or recreation They were an attempt to escape from Guenever They were his struggles to save his honour not to establish it  We shall have to describe one of the quests in detail  so as to show the way in which he tried to distract himself and the way in which this famous honour of his worked Also it will give a picture of the state of England which forced King Arthur to work for his theory of justice It was not that Arthur was a prig  it was that his country of Gramarye lay in such a toil of anarchy in the early days that some idea like the Round Table was needed to make the place survive The warfare of people like Lot had been suppressed but not the unbiddable baronage who lived like gangsters on their own estates Barons were pulling teeth out of Jews to get their money or roasting bishops who contradicted them The villeins who belonged to bad masters were being basted over slow fires or sprinkled with molten lead or impaled or left to die with their eyes gouged  out or else they were crawling along the roads on hands and knees because they had been hamstrung Petty feuds were raging to the destruction of the poor and helpless and if a knight did happen to be dragged from his horse in a battle he was so well screwed up that only an expert could do him harm Philip Augustus of France for instance was dismounted and surrounded at the legendary battle of Bouvines: yet as the unfortunate infantry were quite unable to puncture him he was rescued soon after and continued to fight all the better because he had lost his temper But the story of Lancelots first quest must speak for their troubled age of Might in its own way  There were two knights on the borders of Wales called Sir Carados and Sir Turquine They were of Celtic stock These two conservative barons had never yielded to Arthur and they did not believe in any form of government except the rule of force They had strong castles and wicked retainers who found more opportunity for wickedness under their leadership than they would have found in a settled state of society They existed like eagles to prey on weaker brethren It is unfair to compare them with eagles for many of these birds are noble creatures while Sir Turquine at any rate was not noble If he had lived now he might even have been locked in a lunatic hospital and his friends would certainly have urged him to be psycho analysed  One day when Sir Lancelot had been riding on his adventure for about a month  and all the time going away from where he wanted to be so that every pace of his horse was a torment   there appeared a knight in armour riding a great mare with another bound knight thrown across the saddlebow The bound knight had fainted He was bloody and bedraggled and his head which hung by the mares shoulders had red hair The riding knight who had captured him was a man of enormous stature and Lancelot recognized him by his blazon as Sir Carados  Who is your prisoner  The big knight lifted the prisoners shield which was hanging behind him and showed or a chevron gules between three thistles vert  What are you doing with Sir Gawaine  Mind your own business said Sir Carados  Gawaine must have come to his senses when the mare halted for his voice now said coming from upside down: Is that you man Sir Lancelot  What cheer Gawaine How stands it with you  Never so hard said Sir Gawaine unless that ye help me for without ye rescue me I know nae knight that may  He was speaking formally in the High Language of Chivalry  for in those days there were two kinds of speech like High and Low Dutch or Norman French and Saxon English  Lancelot looked at Sir Carados and said in the vernacular: Will you put that fellow down and fight with me instead  You are a fool said Sir Carados I shall only serve you in the same way  Then they put Gawaine on the ground tied up so that he could not get away and prepared for battle Sir Carados had a squire to give him his spear but Lancelot had insisted on leaving Uncle Dap at home He had to serve himself alone  The fight was different from the one with Arthur For one thing the knights were more evenly matched and in the tilt with which it began neither of them was unhorsed They broke their ashwood spears to splinters but both stayed in the saddle and the horses stood the shock In the sword play which followed Lancelot proved to be the better of the two After little more than an hours fighting he managed to give Sir Carados such a buffet on the helm that it pierced his brain pan  and then while the dead man was still swaying in the saddle he caught him by the collar pulled him under his horses feet dismounted in the same instant and struck off his head He liberated Sir Gawaine who thanked him heartily and rode on again into the wild ways of England without giving Carados another thought He fell in with a young cousin of his own Sir Lionel and they rode together in search of wrongs to redress But it was unwise of them to have forgotten Sir Carados  One day when they had been riding for some time they came to a forest during a sultry noon and Lancelot was so worn out by the struggle inside him about the Queen and by the weather as weil that he felt he could not go further Lionel felt sleepy also so they decided to lie down under an apple tree in a hedge after tying their horses to sundry branches Lancelot went to sleep at once  but the buzzing of the flies kept Sir Lionel awake and while he was awake a curious sight came by  The sight was of three knights fully armed galloping for their lives with a single knight in pursuit of them The horses hoofs thundered on the ground and shook it  so that it was peculiar that Lancelot did not wake up  until one by one the huge pursuer ran his quarries down unhorsed them and bound them prisoners  Lionel was an ambitious boy He thought that he would steal a march on his famous cousin He got up quietly put his armour to rights and rode off to challenge the victor In less than a minute he too was lying on the ground trussed so that he could not move and before Lancelot woke the whole pageant had disappeared The mysterious conqueror in these four battles was Sir Turquine a brother to the Carados whom Lancelot had lately killed His habit  was to take his captives into his grimly castle where he took off all their clothes and whacked them to his hearts content as a hobby  Lancelot was still asleep when a new pageant came prancing by In the middle of it there was a green silk canopy borne on four spears by four knights gorgeously apparelled Under the canopy there rode four middle aged queens on white mules looking picturesque They were passing the apple tree when Lancelots charger gave a brassy neigh Queen Morgan le Fay who was the senior queen of the four  all witches  halted the procession and rode over to Sir Lancelot He looked dangerous as he lay there in full armour of war among the long grasses It is Sir Lancelot  Nothing travels quicker than scandal especially among supernatural people so the four queens knew that he was in love with Guenever They also knew that he was now recognized as the strongest knight in the world They were jealous of Guenever on this account They were delighted by the opportunity which they saw before them They began to quarrel among thelmselves about which of them should have him for her magic  We need not quarrel said Morgan le Fay I will put an enchantment on him so that he does not wake for six hours When we have got him safely into my castle he can choose which of us he will have himself  This was done The sleeping champion was carried on his shield between two knights into the Castle Chariot The castle no longer had its fairy appearance as a castle of food but its everyday aspect of an ordinary fortress There he was put into a cold bare chamber fast asleep and left until the enchantment wore off  When Lancelot woke he did not know where he was The room was dark and seemed to be made of stone like a dungeon He lay in the dark wondering what would happen next Later he began to think about Queen Guenever  The thing which did happen was that a young damsel came in with his dinner and asked him what cheer  How are you Sir Lancelot  I dont know fair damsel I dont know how I got here so I dont rightly know how I am  No need to be frightened she said If you are as great a man as you are supposed to be I may be able to help you tomorrow morning  Thank you Whether you can help me or not I should like you to think kindly of me  So the fair maid went away  In the morning there was banging of bolts and creaking of rusty locks and several retainers in chain mail came into the dungeon They lined up on either side of the door and the magic queens came in behind them all dressed in their best clothes Each of the queens made a stately curtsey to Sir Lancelot He stood up politely and bowed gravely to each of the queens Morgan le Fay introduced them as the queens of Gore Northgalis Eastland and the Out Isles  Now said Morgan le Fay we know about you so you need not think we dont You are Sir Lancelot Dulac and you are having a love affair with Queen Guenever You are supposed to be the best knight in the world and that is why the woman is fond of you Well that is all over now We four queens have you in our power and you have to choose which of us you will have for your mistress It would be no good unless you choose for yourself obviously    but one of us you must have Which is it to be  Lancelot said: How can I possibly answer a thing like that  You have to answer  In the first place he said what you say about me and the Kings wife of Britain is untrue Guenever is the truest lady unto her lord living If I were free or had my armour I would fight any champion you liked to put forward to prove that And in the second place I certainly will not have any of you for my mistress I am sorry if this is discourteous but it is all I can say  Oh said Morgan le Fay  Yes said Lancelot  That is all  Yes  The four queens curtsied with frigid dignity and marched out of the room The sentries made smart about turns their mail ringing on the stone floor The light went out of the door The door slammed and the key creaked and the bolts rumbled into their sockets  When the fair damsel came in with the next meal she showed signs of wanting to talk to him Lancelot noticed that she was a bold creature who was probably fond of getting her own way  You said you might be able to help me  The girl looked suspiciously at him and said: I can help you if you are who you are supposed to be Are you really Sir Lancelot  I am afraid I am  I will help you she said if you will help me  Then she burst into tears  While the damsel is weeping which she did in a charming and determined way we had better explain about the tournaments which used to take place in Gramarye in the early days A real tournament was distinct from a joust In a joust the knights tilted or fenced with each other singly for a prize But a tournament was more like a free fight A body of knights would pick sides so that there were twenty or thirty on either side and then they would rush together harum scarum These mass battles were considered to be important  for instance once you  had paid your green fee for the tournament you were admitted on the same ticket to fight in the jousts  but if you had only paid the jousting fee you were not allowed to fight in the tourney People were liable to be dangerously injured in the melees They were not bad things altogether provided they were properly controlled Unfortunately in the early days they were seldom controlled at all  Merry England in Pendragons time was a little like Poor Ould Ireland in OConnells There were factions The knights of one county or the inhabitants of one district or the retainers of one nobleman might get thelmselves into a state in which they felt a hatred for the faction which lived next door This hatred would become a feud and then the king or leader of the one place would challenge the leader of the other one to a tourney  and both factions would go to the meeting with full intent to do each other mischief It was the same in the days of Papist and Protestant or Stuart and Orangeman who would meet together with shillelaghs in their hands and murder in their hearts  Why are you crying asked Sir Lancelot  Oh dear sobbed the damsel That horrid King of Northgalis has challenged my father to a tournament next Tuesday and he has got three knights of King Arthurs on his side and my poor father is bound to lose I am afraid he will get hurt  I see And what is your fathers name  He is King Bagdemagus  Sir Lancelot got up and kissed her politely on the forehead He saw at once what he was expected to do  Very well he said If you can rescue me out of this prison I will fight in the faction of King Bagdemagus next Tuesday  Oh thank you said the maiden wringing out her handkerchief Now I must go I am afraid or they will miss me downstairs  Naturally she was not going to help the magic Queen of Northgalis to keep Lancelot in prison  when it was the King of Northgalis himself who was going to fight her father  In the morning before the people of the castle had got up Lancelot heard the heavy door opening quietly A soft hand was put in his and he was led out in the darkness They went through twelve magic doors until they reached the armoury and there was all his armour bright and ready When he had put it on they went to the stables and there was his charger scratching on the cobbles with a sparkling shoe  Remember  Of course he said And he rode out over the drawbridge into the morning light  While they had crept through the corridors of Castle Chariot they had made a plan about meeting King Bagdemagus Lancelot was to ride to an abbey of white friars which was situated near by and there he was to meet the damsel  who would of course be forced to  flee from Queen Morgan because of her treachery in letting him escape At this abbey they were to wait until King Bagdemagus could be brought over and then the arrangements for the tournament were to be made Unfortunately the Castle Chariot was in the Forest Sauvage and Lancelot now lost his way to the abbey He and his horse wandered about all day bumping against branches getting tangled in blackberry bushes and rapidly losing their tempers In the evening they stumbled on a pavilion of red sendal with nobody inside  He got off his horse and looked at the pavilion There was something queer about it   luxurious as it was in the rooky wood and without anybody in sight  This is a strange pavilion he thought sadly for his mind was full of Guenever but I suppose I may as well stay in it for the night Either it is here for some adventure or other in which case I ought to try the adventure or else the owners have gone away on holiday and in that case they will not mind my taking shelter for one evening Anyway I am lost and there is nothing else I can do  He unharnessed the horse and spancelled him Then he took off his own armour and hung it neatly on a nearby tree with the shield on top After this he ate some bread which the girl had given him drinking water from a stream which ran beside the pavilion stretched his arms out until the elbows went click yawned hit his front teeth with his fist three times and went to bed The bed was a sumptuous one with a coverlet of red sendal to match the tent Lancelot rolled himself in it pressed his nose into the silk pillow kissed it for Guenever and was fast asleep  It was moonlight when he woke and a naked man was sitting on his left foot trimming bis finger nails  Lancelot who had been woken from his love sleep with a start moved suddenly in the bed when he felt the man The man equally surprised at feeling a movement jumped up and snatched his sword Lancelot jumped out on the other side of the bed and ran for his own arms where they were hanging in the tree The man came after him waving his blade and trying to get a cut at him from behind Lancelot reached the tree in safety and swung round with his weapon in his hand They looked strange and terrible in the moonlight both stark naked with their silver steel glancing under the harvest moon  Now cried the man and he aimed a furious swipe at Lancelots legs The next minute he had dropped his sword and was holding his stomach with both hands doubled up and whistling The cut which Lancelot had given welled over with blood which looked black in the moonlight and you could see some of the insides of the stomach with their secret life laid open  Dont hit me cried the man Mercy Dont hit me again You have killed me  I am sorry said Lancelot You did not even wait till I had a sword  The man went on wailing: Mercy Mercy  Lancelot stuck his blade in the ground and went over to examine the wound  I am not going to hurt you he said Its all right Let me see  You have cut open my liver said the man accusingly  Well I cant do more than say I am sorry even if I have I dont know what we were fighting about anyway Lean on my shoulder and we will get you into bed  When he had got the man to bed and stopped his bleeding and discovered that the wound was not a mortal one a beautiful lady appeared in the opening of the tent They had lit a rush light so that she saw what had happened in a flash and immediately she began screaming at the top of her voice She rushed over to comfort the wounded man and accused Lancelot of being a murderer and carried on a great deal  Do stop howling said the man He is not a murderer We just made a mistake  I was in bed said Lancelot when he came and sat on me and we were both so startled that we had a fight I am sorry that I hurt him  But it was our bed cried the lady like one of the Three Bears What were you doing in our bed  Really he said I am sorry There was nobody in the pavilion when I found it and I was lost and tired so I thought it would not matter if I took a nights lodging  Nor did it matter said the man You are welcome to a nights lodging and I dont think the wound is going to be a bad one after all May I inquire your name  Lancelot  Well exclaimed the man There now my dear look who I have been fighting No wonder I got a bit of a chip I was wondering why my life was spared so easily  So they insisted that Lancelot should stay the night and in the morning they put him on the correct road for the abbey of white friars  Nothing much came of this encounter in the main story except that the knight whose name was Belleus was introduced to the Round Table by Lancelot as soon as he was well again He was the kind of generous fellow that Arthur needed and Lancelot tried to make up for the trouble which he had caused by getting him a seat at the Table  At the abbey of white friars the fair damsel was waiting in a state of excitement She was afraid that he might have let her down His horses hoofs however had no sooner clattered on the cobbles than she came flying from her tower room to welcome him with delight  Father will be here this evening she cried Oh I am so glad you came I was afraid you might have forgotten  Lancelots twisted mouth grinned at the word she had chosen to use Then he changed into civilian dress had a bath and waited for King Bagdemagus  It is a puzzling life in Gramarye he said to himself trying to keep his mind off the young Queen Things happen so quickly One hardly knows where one is half the time and there is  that cousin of mine who vanished under the apple tree who has still to be accounted for What with magic queens and faction tournaments and people getting into bed with you at night and half the family vanishing without trace it is difficult to keep in line  Then he brushed his hair smoothed his gown and went down to meet King Bagdemagus  There is no need to give a long description of the tourney Malory gives it Lancelot picked three knights who were recommended by the young damsel to go with him and he arranged that all four of them should bear the vergescu This was the white shield carried by unfledged knights and Lancelot insisted on this arrangement because he knew that three of his own brethren of the Round Table were going to fight on the other side He did not want them to recognize him because it might cause ill feeling at court On the other hand he felt that it was his duty to fight against them because of the promise which he had given to the damsel The King of Northgalis who was the leader of the opposite side had one hundred and sixty knights in his faction and King Bagdemagus only had eighty Lancelot went for the first knight of the Round Table and put his shoulder out of joint He went for the second one so hard that the unlucky fellow was carried over his horses tail and buried his helm several inches in the ground He hit the third knight on the head so hard that his nose bled and his horse ran away with him By the time he had broken the thigh of the King of Northgalis everybody could see that to all intents and purposes the tournament was over
