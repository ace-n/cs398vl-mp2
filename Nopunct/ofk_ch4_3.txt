The next thing that happened was that our hero set out to discover what had become of Lionel He was free to do so for the first time  for since the disappearance of his cousin he had either been imprisoned by the malignant queens or else he had been discharging his obligations to the girl who had rescued him from them King Bagdemagus got the prize at the tournament before he left and the damsel was almost tearfully grateful Everybody said that they would be friends for ever and that they had only to send each other word if there was anything that anybody could do for anybody in return Then Lancelot mounted his horse got his bearings by asking several peasants where he was and rode off toward the forest of the apple tree where he had lost his cousin He thought that by making an all round the hat cast at the place where he had last seen his cousin he might be able to pick up the scent once more although it was cold  In the forest of the apple tree indeed at the very foot of the tree itself he came across a lady riding a white palfrey The tree was thought to be a magic one which was the reason why such a lot of traffic went on round it  Lady said he do you know of any adventures in this forest  Plenty she said if you are man enough to take them on  I could try  You look a strong man said the lady You have a bold look too in spite of your ears which stick out so frightfully If you like I will take you where the fiercest baron in the world lives but he is sure to kill you  Never mind  I will only take you if you tell me your name It would be murder to take you unless you are a famous knight  My name is Lancelot  I thought it was said the lady Well it is lucky it is  According to the things which people are saying about you you are probably the only knight in the world who can beat the man I am taking you to His name is Sir Turquine  Good  Some say he is a madman He has sixty four knights in prison whom he has captured in single combat and he spends the time beating them with thorns If he captures you he will beat you too all naked  He sounds an exciting man to fight  It is a sort of concentration camp  That is what I have been getting ready for said Sir Lancelot It is what Arthur invented the Round Table to prevent  If I take you to him you must promise to do something for me afterwards  that is if you win  What sort of thing he asked cautiously  You need not be afraid said the lady It is only to vanquish another knight I know of who is distressing some damsels  I will promise that gladly  Well said the lady God He knows how you will get on Anyway I will say a prayer for you while you are fighting  When they had been riding for some time they came to a ford like the one at which he had fought the first fight with King Arthur On the trees round the ford there were hanging rusty helms and melancholy shields  sixty four of them with their bends and chevrons and luces hauriant and merles and eagles displayed and lions passant guardant looking desolate and abandoned The leather of their guiges was green and mildewy It looked like a gamekeepers gallows  In the middle of the glade on the chief tree there hung an enormous copper basin triumphing over the beaten shields The latest shield under it was Lionels  argent a bend gules distinguished with some sort of label of cadency  Lancelot knew what he had to do with this basin and he did it He put his helm in position rode through the dripping leaves to the basin and beat on it with the butt of his spear until the  bottom fell out Then he and the lady stood still in the forest which was as if it had been shocked silent by the hideous noise  Nobody came  His castle is beyond said the lady They went to the castle gates in silence and rode up and down in front of them for half an hour He took off his helm and gauntlets and frowned and bit his finger nails from anxiety  After the half hour was over a gigantic knight came riding through the forest He looked so like Sir Carados   the knight who had been slain at the rescue of Gawaine   that Lancelot was startled Not only was he of the same build but he also had a bound knight thrown across the saddlebow of his mare Most peculiar of all the bound knights shield carried the three thistles and the chevron with a red canton In fact the second of the big knights had captured Gaheris  Gawaines brother Lancelot watched him with a critical eye  It may not be amiss to mention that a good judge of style could often recognize a knight in armour even if he was disguised and bearing the vergescu In later life Lancelot sometimes had to fight disguised because otherwise nobody would fight him Yet Arthur and others generally guessed him by his riding People nowadays can recognize cricketers even when their faces are too far away to be seen and so it was then  Lancelot was a good judge of style because of his long practice As soon as he had watched Sir Turquine for a moment or two he noticed that there was a slight weakness in his seat He remarked to the lady that unless Turquine sat better he thought he would be able to rescue the prisoners As it turned out Turquine did sit better when it came to the tilt so that this particular criticism came to nothing  but it throws a sidelight on jousting and may have been worth mentioning  The riding was the whole thing If a man had the courage to throw himself into the fullest gallop at the moment of impact he generally won Most men faltered a little so that they were not at their best momentum This was why Lancelot constantly gained his tilts He had what Uncle Dap called the ï¿½lan Sometimes when he was in disguise he would ride clumsily on purpose showing daylight at his seat But at the last moment there was always the true dash  so that the onlookers and frequently his wretched opponent could exclaim Ah Lancelot even before the lance drove home  Fair knight he said put down that wounded man and let him test a little Then we two can prove our strengths  Sir Turquine rode up to him and said through his teeth; If you are a knight of the Round Table it will give me great pleasure to knock you down first and whack you afterwards I could do that to you and your whole table with you  It seems a tall order  Then they retreated in the usual way fewtered their spears and charged together like thunder Lancelot at the last moment noticed that he was wrong about Turquines seat In the last flash he realized that Turquine was the finest tiller he had met that he was coming with a hurl as great as his own and that his aim was sure  The knights ducked and drew thelmselves together; the spears struck at the same moment; the horses checked in mid career reared up and fell over backward; the spears burst and went sailing high in the air turning over and over gracefully like the results of high explosive; and the lady on the palfrey looked away When she looked again both horses were down with their backs broken and the knights lay still  Two hours later Lancelot and Turquine were still fighting with their swords  Stop said Turquine I want to speak to you  Lancelot stopped  Who are you asked Sir Turquine You are the finest knight I ever fought with I never saw a man with such good wind Listen I have sixty four prisoners in my castle and I have killed or maimed hundreds of others but none were as good as you If you will have peace and be my friend I will loose my prisoners  It is kind of you  I will do this for you if you are anybody except one person If you are he I must fight you to the death  Who is this person  Lancelot said Sir Turquine If you are Lancelot I must never yield or make friends He killed my brother Carados  I am that man  Sir Turquine made a hissing through his helm and struck craftily before his enemy was ready  Ah would you said Lancelot I only had to pretend I was not myself and I could have had the prisoners safe But you try to kill me without warning  Sir Turquine continued to hiss  I am sorry about Carados said Lancelot He was killed in fair fight and never offered to yield I never had him at mercy He was killed in the middle of the fight  They fought for two more hours The blade was not the only weapon used by knights in armour Sometimes they struck each other with the edges of their shields sometimes they clubbed each other with the pommels of their swords The grass all round was speckled with their blood  little spots like those on trout but with a kind of tail on each spot like a tadpole Sometimes because of their weight they fell over each other The heavy straw stuffed helms of chivalry had such small holes to breathe through that they felt like suffocating Their shields hung wearily not covering them properly  It was over in a second Neither of them spoke Lancelot dropped his sword at a moment of opportunity and caught Turquine by the snout of his helm They fell over and the helm came  off They drew their misericordes for the close work Turquine bounced and shuddered and was dead  Later while Gaheris and the lady were giving him some water Lancelot said:  Whatever was wrong with him he was game I am sorry he would not yield  But think of the maimed knights and the beating  He was the old school he said It is what we have to stop But he was a credit to the old school as a fighter all the same  He was a brute said the lady  Whatever he was he was fond of his brother Look Gaheris will you lend me your horse I want to go on and my own is dead poor creature If you could lend me yours you could go forward and let Lionel and the others out of the castle Tell Lionel to go back to court and not to be a silly fellow I have to ride with this lady Will you do that  You can have my horse certainly said Gaheris You have saved him and me as well How you keep on saving the Orkneys Last time it was Gawaine And Agravaine is in that castle at this minute Of course you can have my horse Lancelot of course you can  8 Lancelot had several other adventures during his first quest  it lasted a year  but perhaps only two are worth repeating in detail They were both mixed up with the conservative ethics of Force Majeur against which the King had started his crusade It was the old school the Norman baronial attitude which provided the adventures at this period  for few people can hate so bitterly and so self righteously as the members of a ruling caste which is being dispossessed The knights of the Round Table were sent out as a measure against Fort Mayne and the choleric barons who lived by Fort Mayne took up the cudgels with the ferocity of despair They would have written to The Times about it if there had been such a paper The best of them convinced thelmselves that Arthur was newfangled and that his knights were degenerate from the standards of their fathers The worst of them made up uglier names than Bolshevist even and allowed the brutal side of their natures to dwell on imaginary enormities which they attributed to the knights The situation became divorced from common sense so that atrocity stories were accepted by the atrocious people Many of the barons whom Lancelot had to put down had worked thelmselves into such a state about him through fear of losing their ancient powers that they believed him to be a sort of poison gas man They fought him with as much unscrupulousness and hatred as if he had been an antichrist and they truly believed thelmselves to be defending the right It became a civil war of ideologies  One day in the fine summer he was riding through the park land of a castle which was strange to him The trees grew dispersedly about the sward  great elms and oaks and beeches  and Lancelot was thinking about Guenever with a heavy heart Before he had parted from the lady who led him to Sir Turquine  and he had done the thing for her which he had promised  they had started a conversation about marriage which had upset him The lady had said that  he ought either to have a wife or a mistress and Lancelot had been angry I cant stop people from saying things if they want to he had said but circumstances make it impossible for me to marry while I consider that having a mistress is no good They argued about it for some time and then parted Now although he had passed several adventures in between he was still thinking of the ladys advice and feeling wretched  There was the sound of bells in the air  and he looked up immediately  A fine peregrine falcon with her music jingling in the whistling wind als clear and her creance trailing behind her was beating along above his head toward the top of one of the elms She was in a temper As soon as she reached the top of the elm she sat down in it looking about her with raging eye and panting beak The creance wrapped itself three times round the nearest bough When she noticed Sir Lancelot riding toward her she tried to fly away again in fury The creance caught her She hung upside down bating with her wings His heart came into his mouth for fear that she would break some feathers In a few moments she ceased to flap and hung upside down revolving slowly looking ignoble and indignant and ridiculous holding her head the right way up like a snakes  Oh Sir Lancelot Sir Lancelot cried an unknown gentlewoman riding toward him at full speed and evidently trying to wring her hands in spite of the reins Oh Sir Lancelot I have lost my falcon  There she is he said in that tree  Oh dear Oh dear cried the lady I was only trying to call her in cranes and the string broke My husband will kill me if I do not catch her again He is so hasty and such a keen falconer  But surely he will not kill you  Oh he will He will not mean it but he will do it He is such a hasty man  Perhaps I could stop him  Oh no said the gentlewoman That would not do at all You might hurt him I would not like you to hurt my dear husband Dont you think you could climb up the tree and catch the hawk instead  Lancelot looked at the gentlewoman and at the tree Then he heaved a deep sigh and remarked as Malory reports him: Well fair lady since that ye know my name and require me of my knighthood to help you I will do what I may to get your hawk; and yet truly I am an ill climber and the tree is passing high and few boughs to help me withal  He had spent his childhood learning to be a fighter It had left him no time for birds nesting like other boys The ladys request which would have given no trouble to people brought up like Arthur or Gawaine really was an upset for him  Lancelot took off his armour sadly with an occasional crooked glance at the horrible tree until he was dressed in his shirt and breeches Then he assaulted the first boughs manfully  while the gentlewoman ran about underneath talking about hawks and husbands and the nice weather they were having  All right he said with his eyes full of bark and a hideous scowl on his face All right All right  At the top of the tree the falcon was in such a tangle with her creance  she had wound it round her neck and wings as usual and was under the impression that it was assaulting her   that Lancelot had to let her stand on the bare hand This she gripped with the fury of hysteria but he patiently disentangled her without minding the stabs Falconers seldom fuss when their hawks hurt them They are too interested  When the hawk was safely rescued from the branches he realized that he would not be able to climb down again with one hand He shouted to the lady who seemed small at the foot of the tree: Look out I am going to tie her jesses to a heavy branch if I can break one off and then throw her down I will get one that is not too heavy so that she comes gently I shall have to throw her out a bit so that she is clear of the boughs  Oh do be careful cried the lady  When Lancelot had done what he said he began to make his way down again with care There were some bad bits on the way where he had to rely on balance alone He was about twenty feet from the ground when a fat knight in full armour came galloping up  Ha Sir LancelotI shouted the fat knight Now I have you where I want you  The lady picked up the falcon and began to go away  Lady said Lancelot wondering how everybody came to know his name  The fat man screamed out: You leave her alone you assassin That is my wife that is She has only been doing what I told her It was a trick Ha Ha Now I have got you without any of your famous armour on and I am going to kill you like drowning a kitten  It is not very knightly said Lancelot with a grimace You might at least let me arm and fight fair  Let you arm you puppy Whatever do you take me for I dont want any of this newfangled nonsense When I catch a man who eats human children roasted I kill him like the vermin he is  But really    Come down come down I cant wait about all day Come down and take your medicine like a man if you are a man  I assure you that I do not roast children  The fat knight grew quite purple in the face and shouted: Liar Liar Devil Come down at once  Lancelot sat on a branch and dangled his feet and bit his fingernails  Do you mean to say he asked that you loosed that falcon on purpose with her cranes on so as to be able to murder me when I was naked  Come down  If I come down I shall do my best to kill you  Buffoon cried the fat knight  Well said Lancleot it is your own fault You should not play dirty tricks For the last time will you let me arm like a gentleman  Certainly not  Lancelot broke off a bough of rotten wood and jumped down on the other side of his horse so that the horse was between them The fat knight rode at him and tried to swipe off his head leaning across the horse between Lancelot parried the stroke with his bough and the knights sword stuck in the wood Then he took the sword away from its owner and slit his throat  Go away said Lancelot to the gentlewoman Stop howling Your husband was a fool and you are a bore I am not sorry I killed him  But he was sorry  The last adventure was also concerned with treachery and a lady The young man was riding mournfully through the fen country  which had not been drained in those days and was probably the wildest part of England It was all secret ways through the marshes which were known only to the Saxon marsh men who had been conquered by Uther Pendragon and the whole sea smelling plain was one vast quack under the low sky The bitterns boomed and the marsh harriers skimmed over the reeds and millions of widgeon and mallard and tufted ducks flew about in various wedges looking like champagne bottles balanced on a nimbus of wings On the salt marshes the geese from Spitzbergen walked and nibbled with their necks bent into their peculiar loop and the fen men stalked them with nets and engines The fen people had spotted bellies and their toes were webbed  at any rate that was the belief in the rest of England They generally killed foreigners  While Lancelot was riding along a straight road which seemed to lead nowhere he saw two people galloping towards him from the other end They turned out to be a knight and his lady The lady was in front going like mad and the knight was after her His sword flashed against the dull sky  Here Here cried Lancelot riding at them  Help screamed the lady Oh save me He is trying to cut my head off  Leave her alone Get out shouted the knight She is my wife and she has been committing adultery  I never did wailed the lady Oh sir save me from him He is a cruel beastly brute Just because I am fond of my cousin german he is jealous Why should I not be fond of my cousin german  Scarlet woman exclaimed the knight and he tried to get at her  Lancelot rode between them and said: Really you must not go for a woman like that I dont care whose fault it is but you cant kill women  Since when  Since King Arthur was king  She is my wife said the knight She is nothing to do with you Get out And she is an adulteress whatever she says  Oh no I am not said the lady But you are a bully And you drink  Who made me drink then And besides it is no worse to drink than be an adulteress  Be quiet said Lancelot both of you This is a nuisance I shall have to ride between you until you cool off I suppose you would not care to have a fight with me sir instead of killing this lady  Certainly not said the knight I know by your argent a bend gules that you are Lancelot; and I would not be such a fool as to fight you especially for a bitch like this What the devil has it got to do with you  I will go said Lancelot as soon as you promise on your knighthood not to kill women  Well I wont promise  You wouldnt said the lady Anyway you would not keep your promise if you did  There are some marsh soldiers said the knight cantering after us Look behind They are armed cap ï¿½ pie  Lancelot reined his horse and looked over his shoulder At the same moment the knight leaned over to his near side and swapped off the ladys head When Lancelot looked back again without seeing any soldiers he found the lady sitting beside him with no head on She slowly began to sag to the left throbbing horribly and fell in the dust There was blood all over his horse  Lancelot grew white about the nostrils  He said I shall kill you for that  The knight immediately jumped off his horse and lay on the ground  Dont kill me he said Mercy She was an adulteress  Lancelot dismounted also and drew his sword  Get up he said Get up and fight you you    The knight scrambled along the ground toward him and threw his arms round his thighs By being close to the avenger he made it difficult for him to swing the sword Mercy His abjection made Lancelot feel horrible  Get up he said Get up and fight Look I will take my armour off and fight you with my sword only  But Mercy mercy was all the knight would say  Lancelot began to shudder not at the knight but at the cruelty in himself He held his sword loathingly and pushed the knight away  Look at all the blood he said  Dont kill me said the knight I yield I yield You cant kill a man at mercy  Lancelot put up his sword and went back from the knight as if he were going back from his own soul He felt in his heart cruelty and cowardice the things which made him brave and kind  Get up he said I wont hurt you Get up go The knight looked at him on all fours like a dog and stood up crouching uncertainly Lancelot went away and was sick  At the feast of Pentecost it was customary for the knights who had been on Table quests to gather again at Carlion so as to relate their adventures Arthur had found that this made people keener on fighting in the new way of Right if they had to tell about it afterwards Most of them preferred to bring their prisoners with them as witnesses to their stories It was as if some Inspector General of Police in a very distant part of Africa were to send out his superintendents into the jungle asking them to come back next Christmas with all the savage chiefs whom they had brought to righteousness For one thing it impressed the savage chiefs to see the great court and they often went home reformed  The Pentecost next after Lancelots first quest was almost a fiasco A few seedy giants of the Strong Arm who had been captured by the Orkney faction turned up and said their homage but the Lancelot contingent was a spate Whose man are you Lancelots And whose are you my good fellow Lancelots After a bit the whole Table began shouting the answers Arthur would say: You are welcome to Carlion Sir Belleus and may I ask which of my knights you have yielded to Lancelot the Table would shout in chorus And Sir Belleus blushing rather and wondering whether the laughter was at him would say in a small voice: Yes I yielded to Sir Lancelot  Sir Bedivere came and admitted how he had swapped off his adulterous wifes head He had brought it with him and was told to take it to the Pope as a penance  he became very holy after that Gawaine came gruffly and told in Scottish English how he had been rescued from Sir Carados Gaheris at the head of a deputation of sixty four knights with rusty shields related his rescue from Sir Turquine The daughter of King Bagdemagus arrived in an  enthusiastic state and told about the tournament with the King of Northgalis Besides these there were many people from adventures which we have left out  mainly knights who had yielded to Sir Lancelot when he was disguised as Sir Kay  You may remember from the first book that Kay was inclined to throw his tongue a bit too much and he had got himself unpopular on account of this Lancelot had been compelled during the quest to rescue him from three knights who were pursuing him Then so that Kay could get home to court unmolested Lancelot had changed armour with him one night while he was asleep  and thereafter the knights who went for Lancelot under the impression that he was Kay had gotten the surprise of their lives while the knights who met Kay in Lancelots armour had given him a wide berth Knights yielded under this category included Gawaine Uwaine Sagramour Ector de Maris and three others Also there came a knight called Sir Meliot de Logres who had been rescued under supernatural circumstances  All these people gave thelmselves up not to King Arthur but to Guenever Lancelot had kept himself away for a whole year but there was a limit to his endurance Thinking of her all the time and longing to be back with her he had allowed himself this one indulgence He had sent his captives to kneel at her feet It was a fatal course of action  9 It is difficult to explain about Guenever unless it it is possible to love two people at the same time Probably it is not possible to love two people in the same way but there are different kinds of love Women love their children and their husbands at the same time  and men often feel a lusty thought for one woman while they are feeling a love of the heart for another In some way such as this Guenever did come to love the Frenchman without losing her affection for Arthur She and Lancelot were hardly more than children when it began and the King was about eight years their senior At twenty two the age of thirty seems to be the verge of senility The marriage between her and Arthur had been what they call a made marriage That is to say it had been fixed by treaty with King Leodegrance without consulting her It had been a successful union as made marriages generally are and before Lancelot came on the scene the young girl had adored her famous husband even if he was so old She had felt respect for him with gratitude kindness love and a sense of protection She had felt more than this  you might say that she had felt everything except the passion of romance  And then the captives arrived A blushing queen of little more than twenty summers on her throne and the whole flame lit hall filling with noble knights on bended knee Whose prisoner are you I am the Queens prisoner to live or die sent by Sir Lancelot Whose you The Queens by Lancelots arm Sir Lancelot  the name on everybodys lips: the best knight in the world top of the averages even above Tristram: the courtly the merciful the ugly the invincible: and he had sent them all to her It was like a birthday party so many presents It was like the story books  Guenever sat straight and bowed royally to her prisoners She pardoned them all Her eyes were brighter than her crown  Lancelot came last There was a stir among the torch bearers near the door and a sound went round the hall The clatter of knives and plates and tankards the noise of friendly shouting  which had sounded a moment before like a meeting of seabirds on St Kilda the yells for more mutton or a pint of mead were stilled  and the blurs of white faces turned toward the door There was Lancelot no longer in armour but dressed in a magnificent velvet robe scalloped and diapered He hesitated in the dark frame hideous and friendly wondering why the silence was  and the lights showed him up Then the faces turned back again the seabird meeting started once more and Lancelot came forward to kiss the Kings hand  It was the moment Perhaps it is better than trying to explain  Well Lance said Arthur cheerfully these are some high jinks and no mistake about it Jenny can hardly sit still with all her captives  They were for her said Lancelot The Queen and he did not look at each other They had done so with the click of two magnets coming together the moment that he crossed the threshold  I cant help thinking they were for me too said the King The result ought to be that you have made me a present of about three counties  Lancelot felt a need to prevent silence He began talking too quickly  Three counties is not much he said for the Emperor of all Europe You speak as if you had never conquered the Dictator of Rome How are your dominions getting on  They are getting on as you make them Lance It was no good conquering the Dictator unless you and the others do the civilizing part What is the use of being the Emperor of Europe if the whole place is fighting mad  Guenever supported her hero in the effort against silence It was their first partnership  You are a strange man she said Arthur dear You fight all the time and conquer countries and win battles and then you say that fighting is a bad thing  So it is a bad thing It is the worst thing in the world Oh God we neednt explain it again  No  How is the Orkney faction asked the younger man hastily How is your famous civilization going Might for Right You mustnt forget I have been away a year  The King put his head in his hands and looked miserably at the table between his elbows He was a kind conscientious peace loving fellow who had been afflicted in his youth by a tutor of genius Between the two of them they had worked out their theory that killing people and being a tyrant over them was wrong To stop this sort of thing they had invented the idea of the Table  a vague idea like democracy or sportsmanship or morals  and now in the effort to impose a world of peace he found himself up to the elbows in blood When he was feeling healthy he did not grieve much because he knew the dilemma was inevitable  but in weak moments he was persecuted by shame and indecision He was one of the first Nordic men who had invented civilization or who had desired to do otherwise than Attila the Hun had done and the battle against chaos sometimes did not seem to be worth fighting He often  thought that it might have been better for all his dead soldiers to be alive  even if they had lived under tyranny and madness  rather than be quite dead  The Orkney faction is bad he said So is civilization except for the bit which you have just brought in Before you came I was thinking that I was the Emperor of nothing  now I feel as if I were the Emperor of three counties  What is wrong with the Orkney faction Oh God must we talk about it when we were feeling happy because you had come back I suppose we must It is Morgause said the Queen Partly Morgause is having love affairs with anybody she can get hold of now that Lot is dead How I wish King Pellinore had not had that unfortunate accident when he killed him It is having a bad effect on her children How do you mean  The King scratched on the table and stated: I wish you had not conquered Gawaine that time when you were disguised as Kay I almost wish you had not made such brilliant successes in rescuing him and his brothers from Carados and Turquine Why not  This Round Table said the older man slowly was a good thing when we thought of it It was necessary to invent a way for the fighting men to express thelmselves without doing harm I cant see how we could have done it otherwise than by starting a fashion like children To get them in we had to have a gang as kids have in schools Then the gang had to swear a darksome oath that they would only fight for our ideas You could call it for civilization What I meant by civilization when I invented it was simply that people ought not to take advantage of weakness  not violate maidens and rob widows and kill a man when he was down People ought to be civil But it has turned into sportsmanship Merlin always said that sportsmanship was the curse of the world and so it is My scheme is going wrong All these knights now are making a fetish of it They are turning it into a competitive thing Merlin used to call it Games Mania Everybody gossips and nags and hints and speculates about who unseated whom last and who has rescued most virgins and who is the best knight of the Table I made it a round table to prevent that very thing but it has not prevented it The Orkney faction have got the craze worst I suppose their sense of insecurity over their mother makes it necessary for them to be sure of a safe place at the top of the list They have to excel to make up for her That is why I wish you had not beaten Gawaine He is a decent chap but he will hold it against you inside himself You have hurt him in his tilting average  it is a part of their make up which has now become more important to my knights than their souls If you are not careful you will have the Orkney faction after your blood as well as after poor Pellinores Its a foul position People will do the basest things on account of their so called honour I wish I had never invented honour or sportsmanship or civilization  What a speech said Lancelot Cheer up The faction wont hurt me even if it does come after my blood As for your scheme going wrong that is nonsense The Round Table is the best thing that ever happened  Arthur whose head was still in his hands raised his eyes He saw that his friend and his wife were looking at each other with the wide pupils of madness so he quickly attended to his plate  10  Uncle Dap said turning the helm round in his hands: Your mantling is cut and torn We shall have to get another It is honourable to have the mantling slashed but dishonourable to keep it so when there is an opportunity to replace it Such a course of action would be boastful  They were talking in a little closet with a north window cold and grey and the blue light lay like frozen oil upon the steel  Yes  How did Joyeux go Is he sharp still Did you like his balance  Joyeux had been made by Galand the greatest sword smith of the Middle Ages  Yes  Yes Yes cried Uncle Dap Can you say nothing but Yes Death of my soul Lancelot but one asks if you are dumb What in the world is this that has come over you in the end  Lancelot had been smoothing the panache of feathers which was used as a distinguishing mark on the helm in  Uncle Daps hands It was detachable People have got it into their heads through the cinema and the comic advertisements that knights in armour generally wore ostrich plumes nodding like stalks of pampas grass This was not the case Kays panache for instance was shaped like a rigid flat fan with its edges pointing fore and aft It was carefully arranged out of the eyes of peacock feathers exactly as if a stiff peacock fan had been erected endwise on his head It was not a tuft of plumes and it did not nod It was rather like the adipose fin of a fish but gaudy Lancelot who did not care for gaudy things wore a few herons hackles bound with silver thread which suited the argent of his shield He had been stroking them Now he threw them violently into a corner and stood up He began walking the narrow room in a jerky way  Uncle Dap he said do you remember how I asked you not to talk about something  I do  Is Guenever in love with me  You should ask her replied his uncle with French logic  What must I do he cried What must I do  If it is difficult to explain about Guenevers love for two men at the same time it is almost impossible to explain about Lancelot At least it would be impossible nowadays when everybody is so free from superstitions and prejudice that it is only necessary for all of us to do as we please Why did not Lancelot make love to Guenever or run away with his heros wife altogether as any enlightened man would do today  One reason for his dilemma was that he was a Christian The modern world is apt to forget that several people were Christians in the remote past and in Lancelots time there were no Protestants  except John Scotus Erigena His Church in which he had been brought up  and it is difficult to escape from your upbringing  directly forbade him to seduce his best friends wife Another stumbling block to doing as he pleased was the very idea of chivalry or of civilization which Arthur had first invented and then introduced into his own young mind Perhaps a bad baron who believed in the Strong Arm might have gone off with Guenever even in the face of his Churchs councils because taking your neighbours wife was really a form of Fort Mayne It was a matter of the stronger bull winning  But Lancelot had spent his childhood between knightly exercises and thinking out King Arthurs theory for himself He believed as firmly as Arthur did as firmly as the benighted Christian that there was such a thing as Right Finally there was the impediment of his nature In the secret parts of his peculiar brain those unhappy and inextricable tangles which he felt at the roots the boy was disabled by something which we cannot explain He could not have explained either and for us it is all too long ago He loved Arthur and he loved Guenever and he hated himself The best knight of the world: everybody envied the self  esteem which must surely be his But Lancelot never believed he was good or nice Under the grotesque magnificent shell with a face like Quasimodos there was shame and self loathing which had been planted there when he was tiny by something which it is now too late to trace It is so fatally easy to make young children believe that they are horrible  It seems to me said Uncle Dap that it depends very largely on what the Queen wants to do  11 Lancelot stayed at the court for several weeks this time and each week made it more difficult to go away On top of the more or less social tangle in which he found himself there was a personal puzzle  for he put a higher value on chastity than is fashionable in our century He believed like the man in Lord Tennyson that people could only have the strength of ten on account of their hearts being pure It so happened that his strength was as the strength of ten and such was the medieval explanation which had been discovered for it As a corollary to this belief he supposed that if he gave in to the Queen he would lose his tenfold might So for this reason as well as for the other ones he fought against her with the courage of despair It was not pleasant for Guenever either  One day Uncle Dap said: You had better go away You have lost nearly two stone in weight If you go away  something will either snap or not snap It is better to get it over quickly  Lancelot said: I cannot go  Arthur said: Please stay  Guenever said: Go  The second quest which he embarked upon was the turning point of his life There had been a good deal of talk in Camelot about a certain King Pelles who was lame and lived in the haunted castle of Corbin He was supposed to be slightly mad because he believed himself to be a relation of Joseph of Arimathea He was the sort of man who would become a British Israelite nowadays and spend the rest of his life prophesying the end of the world by measuring the passages in the Great Pyramid However King Pelles was only slightly mad and his castle was certainly haunted It had a haunted room in it with innumerable doors out of which things came and fought you in the night Arthur thought it was worth sending Lancelot to investigate the place  On the way to Corbin Lancelot had a strange adventure which he remembered for many years with awful grief He was to look back on it as the last adventure of his virginity and to believe day by day for the next twenty years that before it had happened he had been Gods man while after it he had become a lie  There was a village under the castle of Corbin which seemed a prosperous one It had cobbled streets and stone houses and old bridges The castle stood on a hill to one side of the valley and there was a handsome pele tower on the hill of the other side All the people of the village were in the street as if they were waiting for nun and there was a dreamlike quality in the air as if a shower of gold dust had come from the sun Lancelot felt peculiar His blood might have had too much oxygen in it from the way he was conscious of every stone in every wall and all the colours in the valley and the joyful stepping of his horse The people of the enchanted village knew his name  Welcome Sir Lancelot Dulac they cried the flower of all knighthood 1 By thee we shall be holpen out of danger  He reined his horse and spoke to them  Why do you call out to me he asked thinking of other things How do you know my name What is the matter  They answered in chorus speaking together solemnly and without difficulty  Ah fair knight they said Do you see that tower on the hill There is a dolorous lady in it who has been kept boiling in scalding water for many winters by magic and nobody can get her out except the best knight in the world Sir Gawaine was here last week but he could not do it  If Sir Gawaine could not do it he said I am sure that I cant  He did not like this sort of competition The danger about being the best knight in the world was that if you were always being tested about it the day was bound to come when you would fail to retain the title  I think I had better ride on he said and he gave his reins a shake  No no said the people gravely You are Sir Lancelot and we know it You will get our lady out of the boiling water  I must go  She is in pain  Lancelot leaned on the withers of his horse lifted his right leg over the crupper and found himself on the ground Tell me what I must do he said  The people formed in a procession round him and the mayor of the village took him by the hand They walked together silently up the hill to the pele tower except that the major explained the situation as they went  Our lady of the manor said the mayor used to be the most beautiful girl in the country So Queen Morgan le Fay and the Queen of Northgalis grew jealous of her and they have put her in this magic for revenge It is terrible how it hurts her and she has been boiling for five years Only the best knight in the world can get her out  When they came to the tower gate another strange thing happened It was heavily bolted and barred in the old fashioned way The masonry of the doorway was constructed with deep slots in it in which heavy beams ran to and fro   heavy enough to withstand a battering ram Now these beams withdrew into the wall of their own accord and the iron locks turned their own wards with a grinding noise The door quietly opened  Go in said the mayor and the people stood still outside waiting for what was to happen  On the first floor of the tower there was the furnace which kept the magic water hot Lancelot could not enter there On the second floor there was a room full of steam so that he could not see across it He went into this room holding his hands joined together in front of him as blind people do until he heard a squeak A clearing in the steam caused by the draught from the door so long unopened showed him the lady who had given the squeak She was sitting shyly in the bath looking at him a charming little lady who was  as Malory puts it  as naked as a needle WellJ said he  The girl blushed so far as she could blush when she was boiled and said in a small voice: Please give me your hand She knew how the magic had to be undone  Lancelot gave her his hand and she stood up and got out of the bath and all the people outside began cheering as though they knew exactly what was happening They had brought a dress with them and the proper underwear and the ladies of the village formed a circle in the gateway while the pink girl was dressed  Oh it does feel lovely to be dressed she said My popsy cried a fat old woman who had evidently been her nurse when she was small weeping tears of joy  Sir Lancelot done it shouted the villagers Three cheers for Sir LancelotI  When the cheering had died away the boiled girl came to him and put her hand in his  Thank you she said Ought we to go to church now and thank God as well as you Certainly we must  So they went to the clean little chapel in the village and thanked God for His mercies They kneeled between the frescoed walls where some important looking saints with blue haloes were standing on tiptoe to avoid foreshortening and the gay paints of the stained glass window poured upon their heads They were cobalt blue purple from manganese yellow from copper red and a green which was also got from copper The whole inside of the place was a tankful of colour It was half way through the service before he realized that he had been allowed to do a miracle just as he had always wanted  King Pelles limped down from his castle on the other side of the valley to find out what the excitement was about He looked at Lancelots shield kissed the boiled child absent  mindedly leaning over like an obedient stork to have his cheek pecked and remarked: Dear me you are Sir Lancelot And I see you have fetched my daughter out of that kettle arrangement How kind of you It was prophesied long ago I am King Pelles near cousin to Joseph of Arimathea  and you of course are but the eighth degree from Our Lord Jesus Christ  Good gracious  Indeed indeed said King Pelles It is all written down arithmetically in the stones at Stonehenge and I have some sort of holy dish in my castle at Carbonek together with a dove which flies about in various directions holding a censer of gold in its beak Still it was extremely kind of you to fetch my daughter out of the kettle  Daddy said the girl We ought to be introduced  King Pelles waved his hand as if he were trying to scare away the midges  Elaine he said It was another one with the same name This is my daughter Elaine How do you do And this is Sir Lancelot Dulac How do you do All written in the stones  Lancelot perhaps slightly biased by having first met her with no clothes on thought that Elaine was the most beautiful girl he had seen except Guenever He felt shy too  You must come and stay with me said the King That is in the stones also Show you the holy dish some day and all that Teach you arithmetic Nice weather Dont have daughters unboiled every day I think dinner will be ready  12 Lancelot stayed at the castle of Corbin for days Its haunted rooms were up to expectation and there was nothing else to do He felt such feelings in his breast because of Guenever  the frightful pang of hopeless love  that he was drained of effort He could not summon the energy to go elsewhere At the beginning of his love for her there had been restlessness so that he had felt that if only he kept moving and doing new things every moment there might be a hope of escape Now his power to be busy was gone He felt that he might as well be in one place as another if he was only waiting to see whether his heart would break or not He was too simple to see that if the finest knight in the world rescued you out of a kettle of boiling water with no clothes on you would be likely to fall in love with him   if you were only eighteen  One evening when Pelles had been particularly tiresome about religious family trees and when the gnawing in the boys heart had made it impossible for him to eat properly or even to sit still at dinner the butler took the situation in hand He had served the Pelles family for forty years was married to the nurse who had greeted Elaine with tears of joy and he approved of love He also understood about young men like Lancelot  young men who might still be undergraduates or jet pilots if they were in England today He would have made an excellent college butler More wine sir asked the butler No thank you  The butler bowed politely and poured another horn which Lancelot drained without looking at it  A nice vintage sir said the butler His Majesty takes great trouble with his cellar  King Pelles had gone to the library to work out some prognostications and his guest was left gloomily in the hall Yes  There was a rustling outside the buttery door and the butler went over to it while Lancelot was drinking another measure  Now this is a fine wine sir said the butler His Majesty sets great store by this wine and my wife has just fetched up a fresh bottle from the cellar Observe the crust sir It is a wine which I am sure you will appreciate All wines are the same to me  You modest young gentleman said the butler substituting a large horn If I may say so sir you will have your little joke But it is easy to recognize a judge of wine when you come across him  He was bothering Lancelot who wanted to be alone with his misery and Lancelot realized that he was being bothered For this reason he automatically wondered whether he had not perhaps been discourteous to the butler in his distraction Perhaps the butler was really keen on the wine and had troubles of his own He politely drank it up  Very nice he said encouragingly A splendid vintage  I am glad to hear you praise it sir  Have you ever asked Lancelot putting the question which all young men are always asking and without noticing that it had anything to do with the drink have you ever been in love  The butler smiled discreetly and poured another bumper  By midnight Lancelot and the butler were sitting on opposite sides of the table both looking red in the face They had a brew of piment between them  a mixture of red wine honey spices and whatever else the butlers wife had added  So I tell you said Lancelot glaring like an ape Wouldnt tell everybody but you are a nice chap Understanding chap Pleasure to tell anything Have another drink  Good health said the butler  What am I to do he cried What am I to do  He put bis horrible head between his arms on the table and began to weep  Courage said the butler Do or die  He made a rapping on the table with one hand looking at the buttery door and with the other poured out another bumper  Drink he said Drink hearty Be a man sir if I may make so bold You will have good news in a minute that you will and you want to seize the unforgiving minute as the bard says  Good chap said Lancelot Damned if I wouldnt if I could  Jack is as good as his master  Certainly is said the young man winking in a way which he was afraid must look most beastly Better in fact eh butler  He began to grin like an ass  Ah said the butler and there is my wife Brisen at the buttery door holding a message I dare say it might be for you  What does it say asked the butler watching the boy who sat staring at the paper  Nothing he said throwing the paper on the table and walking unsteadily to the door  The butler read the paper  It says that Queen Guenever is at the castle of Case five miles from here and she wants you It says the King is not with her There are some kisses on it  Well  You dare not go said the butler  Dare not shouted Sir Lancelot and he went into the darkness staggering laughing like a caricature and calling for his horse  In the morning he woke suddenly in a strange room It was quite dark with tapestry over the windows and he had no headache because his constitution was good He jumped out of bed and went to the window to draw the curtain He was fully aware in the suddenness of a second of all that bad happened on the previous night  aware of the butler and of the drink and of the love potion which had perhaps been put in it of the message from Guenever and of the dark solid cool fired body in the bed which he had just got out of He drew the curtain and leaned his forehead against the cold stone of the mullion He was miserable  Jenny he said after minutes which seemed to be hours  There was no answer from the bed  He turned round and found himself looking at the boiled girl Elaine She lay in the bed her small bare arms holding the bedclothes to her sides with her violet eyes fixed on his  Lancelot was always a martyr to his feelings never any good at disguising them When he saw Elaine his head went back Then his ugly face took on a look of profound and outraged sorrow so simple and truthful that his nakedness in the window light was dignity He began to tremble  Elaine did not move but only looked upon him with her quick eyes like a mouse  Lancelot went over to the chest where his sword was lying  I shall kill you  She only looked She was eighteen pitifully small in the big bed and she was frightened  Why did you do it he cried What have you done Why have you betrayed me  I had to  But it was treacheryl  He could not believe it of her  It was treachery You have betrayed me  Why  You have made me  taken from me  stolen    He threw his sword into a corner and sat down on the chest When he began to cry the gross lines of his face screwed thelmselves up fantastically The thing which Elaine had stolen from him was his might She had stolen his strength of ten Children believe such things to this day and think that they will only be able to bowl well in the cricket match tomorrow provided that they are good today  Lancelot stopped crying and spoke with his eyes on the floor  When I was little he said I prayed to God that he would let me work a miracle Only virgins can work miracles I wanted to be the best knight in the world I was ugly and lonely The people of your village said that I was the best knight of the world and I did work my Miracle when I got you out of the water I did not know it would be my last as well as my first  Elaine said: Oh Lancelot you will work plenty more  Never You have stolen my miracles You have stolen my being the best knight Elaine why did you do it  She began to cry  He got up wrapped himself in a towel and went over to the bed  Never mind he said It was my fault for getting drunk I was miserable and I got drunk I wonder if that butler tried to make me It was not very fair if he did Dont cry Elaine It was not your fault  It was It was  Probably your father made you do it so as to have the eighth degree from Our Lord in the family Or else it was that enchantress Brisen the butlers wife Dont be sorry about it Elaine It is over now Look I will give you a kiss  Lancelot cried Elaine It was because I loved you Havent I given something too I was a maiden Lancelot I didnt rob you Oh Lancelot  it was my fault I ought to be killed Why didnt you kill me with your sword But it was because I loved you and I couldnt help it  There there  Lancelot suppose I have a baby  He stopped comforting her and went to the window again as if he were going mad  I want to have your baby said Elaine I shall call him Galahad like your first name  She still held the coverlet to her sides with the small bare arms Lancelot turned upon her in fury  Elaine he said if you have a baby it is your baby It is unfair to bind me with pity I am going straight away now and I hope I shall never see you again  13 Guenever was doing some petit point in the gloomy room which she hated doing It was for a shield cover for Arthur and had the dragon rampant gules Elaine was only eighteen and it is fairly easy to explain the feelings of a child  but Guenever was twenty two She had grown to have some of the nature of an individual stamped on the simple feelings of the child queen who had once received her present of captives  There is a thing called knowledge of the world which people do not have until they are middle aged It is something which cannot be taught to younger people because it is not logical and does not obey laws which are constant It has no rules Only in the long years which bring women to the middle of life a sense of balance develops You cant teach a baby to walk by explaining the matter to her logically  she has to learn the strange poise of walking by experience In some way like that you cannot teach a young woman to have knowledge of the world She has to be left to the experience of the years And then when she is beginning to hate her used body she suddenly finds that she can do it She can go on living  not by principle not by deduction not by knowledge of good and evil but simply by  a peculiar and shifting sense of balance which defies each of these things often She no longer hopes to live by seeking the truth  if women ever do hope this  but continues henceforth under the guidance of a seventh sense Balance was the sixth sense which she won when she first learned to walk and now she has the seventh one  knowledge of the world  The slow discovery of the seventh sense by which both men and women contrive to ride the waves of a world in which there is war adultery compromise fear stultification and hypocrisy  this discovery is not a matter for triumph The baby perhaps cries out triumphantly: I have balance But the seventh sense is recognized without a cry We only carry on with our famous knowledge of the world riding the queer waves in a habitual petrifying way because we have reached a stage of deadlock in which we can think of nothing else to do  And at this stage we begin to forget that there ever was a time when we lacked the seventh sense We begin to forget as we go stolidly balancing along that there could have been a time when we were young bodies flaming with the impetus of life It is hardly consoling to remember such a feeling and so it deadens in our minds  But there was a time when each of us stood naked before the world confronting life as a serious problem with which we were intimately and passionately concerned There was a time when it was of vital interest to us to find out whether there was a God or not Obviously the existence or otherwise of a future life must be of the very first importance to somebody who is going to live her present one because her manner of living it must hinge on the problem There was a time when Free Love versus Catholic Morality was a question of as much importance to our hot bodies as if a pistol had been clapped to our heads  Further back there were times when we wondered with all our souls what the world was what love was what we were ourselves  All these problems and feelings fade away when we get the seventh sense Middle aged people can balance between believing in God and breaking all the commandments without difficulty The seventh sense indeed slowly kills all the other ones so that at last there is no trouble about the commandments We cannot see any more or feel or hear about them The bodies which we loved the truths which we sought the Gods whom we questioned: we are deaf and blind to them now safely and automatically balancing along toward the inevitable grave under the protection of our last sense Thank God for the aged sings the poet:  Thank God for the aged And for age itself and illness and the grave When we are old and ill and particularly in the coffin It is no trouble to behave  Guenever was twenty two as she sat at her petit point and thought of Lancelot She was not half way to her coffin not ill even and she only had six senses It is difficult to imagine her  A chaos of the mind and body  a time for weeping at sunsets and at the glamour of moonlight  a confusion and profusion of beliefs and hopes in God in Truth in Love and in Eternity  an ability to be transported by the beauty of physical objects  a heart to ache or swell  a joy so joyful and a sorrow so sorrowful that oceans could lie between them: then as a counterpoise to these attractive features outcrops of selfishness indecently exposed    restlessness or inability to settle down and stop bothering the middle aged  pert argument on abstract subjects like Beauty as if they were of any interest to the middle aged   lack of experience as to when truth should be suppressed in deference to the middle aged  general effervescence and nuisance and unfittingness to the set patterns of the seventh sense  these must have been some of Guenevers characteristics at twenty two because they are everybodys But on top of them there were the broad and yet uncertain lines of her personal character  lines which made her different from the innocent Elaine lines of less pathos perhaps but more reality lines of power which made her into the individual Jenny that Lancelot loved  Oh Lancelot she sang as she stitched at the shield crown Oh Lance come back soon Come back with your crooked smile or with your own way of walking which shows whether you are angry or puzzled  come back to tell me that it does not matter whether love is a sin or not Come back to say that it is enough that I should be Jenny and you should be Lance whatever may happen to anybody  The startling thing was that he came Straight from Elaine straight from her robbery Lancelot came like an arrow to the heart of love He had slept with Guenever already in deceit already had been cheated of his tenfold might He was a lie now in Gods eyes as he saw them so he felt that he might as well be a lie in earnest No more to be the best knight in the world no more to work miracles against magic no more to have compensation for ugliness and emptiness in his soul the young man sped to his sweetheart for consolation There was the clatter of his iron shod horse on the cobbles which made the Queen drop her needlework to see whether it was Arthur back from his hunting  the ring of his chain mail feet upon the stairs going chink chink like spurs against the stone  and then before she was quite certain of what had happened Guenever was laughing or weeping unfaithful to her husband as she had always known she would be  14 Arthur said: Here is a letter from your father Lance He says he is being atttacked by King Claudas I promised to help him against Claudas if it was necessary in exchange for his help at Bedegraine I shall have to go  I see  What do you want to do  How do you mean what do I want to do  Well do you want to come with me or to stay here  Lancelot cleared his throat and said: I want to do whatever you think best  It will be difficult for you said Arthur I hate to ask you But would you mind if I asked you to stay  Lancelot could not think of the safe words so the King mistook his silence for disappointment  Of course you have a right to see your father and mother he said I dont want you to stay if it hurts too much Probably we can manage it another way  Why did you want to leave me in England  There ought to be somebody here to look after the factions I should feel safer in France if I knew there was a strong man left behind There is going to be trouble in Cornwall soon between Tristram and Mark and there is the Orkney feud You know the difficulties And it would be nice to think there was somebody looking after Gwen  Perhaps said Lancelot choosing the words with pain it would be better to trust somebody else  Dont be absurd How could I trust anybody more You would only have to show that mug of yours outside the dog kennel and all the thieves would run away at once  It is not a very handsome one  Cut throat exclaimed the King affectionately and he thumped his friend on the back He went off to arrange about the expedition  They had a year of joy twelve months of the strange heaven which the salmon know on beds of river shingle under the gin clear water For twenty four years they were guilty but this first year was the only one which seemed like happiness Looking back on it when they were old they did not remember that in this year it had ever rained or frozen The four seasons were coloured like the edge of a rose petal for them  I dont understand said Lancelot why you should love me Are you sure you do Is there some mistake about it  My Lance  But my face he said I am so horrible Now I can believe that God might love the world whatever it was like because of himself  At other times they were in a terror which came from him Guenever did not feel remorse on her own account but she caught it from her lover  I dare not think Dont think Kiss me Jenny  Why think  I cant help thinking  Dear Lance  Then there were different times when they quarrelled about nothing  but even the quarrels were those of lovers which seemed sweet when they remembered them afterwards  Your toes are like the little pigs which went to market  I wish you would not say things like that It is not respectful  Respectful  Yes respectful Why shouldnt you be respectful I am the Queen after all  Do you seriously mean to tell me that I am supposed to treat you with respect I suppose I am to kneel on one knee all the time and kiss your hand  Why not  I wish you wouldnt be so selfish If there is one thing I cant stand it is being treated like a possession  Selfish indeed  And the Queen would stamp her foot or perhaps sulk for a day But she forgave him when he had made a proper act of contrition  One day when they were at the stage of telling each other their private feelings with a sort of innocent amazement when they corresponded Lancelot gave the Queen his secret  Jenny when I was little I hated myself I dont know why I was ashamed I was a very holy little boy  You are not very holy now she said laughing She did not understand what she was being told  One day my brother asked me to lend him an arrow I had two or three specially straight ones which I was very careful of and his were a bit warped I pretended that I had lost my straight arrows and said I couldnt lend them to him  Little liar  I know I was Afterwards I had the most dreadful remorse for having told him the lie and I thought I had been untrue to God So I went out to a bed of stinging nettles that was on the moat and put my arrow arm into them as a punishment I rolled up my sleeve and put it right in Poor Lance What an innocent you must have been But Jenny they didnt sting me I am sure I am right in remembering that they didnt sting me Do you mean there was a miracle I dont know It is difficult to be sure I was such a dreamy boy always living in a make up world where I was Arthurs greatest knight I may have made it up about the nettles But I think I can remember the shock when they didnt sting  I am sure it was a miracle said the Queen decidedly Jenny all my life I have wanted to do miracles I have wanted to be holy I suppose it was ambition or pride or some other unworthy thing It was not enough for me to conquer the world  I wanted to conquer heaven too I was so grasping that it was not enough to be the strongest knight  I had to be the best as well That is the worst of making day dreams It is why I tried to keep away from you I knew that if I was not pure I could never do miracles  And I did do a miracle too: a splendid one I got a girl out of some boiling water who was enchanted into it She was called Elaine Then I lost my power Now that we are together I shall never be able to do my miracles any more  He did not like to tell her the full truth about Elaine for he thought that it would hurt her feelings to know that he had come to her as the second  Why not  Because we are wicked  Personally I have never done a miracle said the Queen rather coldly So I have less to regret  But Jenny I am not regretting anything You are my miracle and I would throw them overboard all over again for the sake of you I was only trying to tell you about the things I felt when I was small  Well I cant say I understand  Cant you understand wanting to be good at things No I can see that you would not have to It is only people who are lacking or bad or inferior who have to be good at things You have always been full and perfect so you had nothing to make up for But I have always been making up I feel dreadful sometimes even now with you when I know that I cant be the best knight any longer  Then we had better stop and you can make a good confession and do some more miracles  You know we cant stop  The whole thing seems fanciful to me said the Queen I dont understand it It seems unpractical and selfish  I know I am selfish I cant help it I try not to be But how can I help being what I was made Oh cant you understand what I am telling you I was lonely when I was small and I worked hard at my exercises I used to tell myself that I would be a great explorer and cross the Chorasmian Waste: or I would be a great king like Alexander or St Louis: or a great healer: I would find out a balsam which cured wounds and give it away free: perhaps I would be a saint and salve wounds just by touching them or I would find something important  a relic of the True Cross or the Holy Grail or something like that These were my dreams Jenny I am only telling you what I used to day dream about They are what I mean by my miracles which are lost now I have given you my hopes Jenny as a present from my love  15 The year of their happiness ended with Arthurs return  and almost immediately collapsed in ruin but not on account of the King The evening after his home coming while he was still giving them details of the defeat of Claudas as they happened to come into his memory there was a disturbance at the Porters Lodge and Sir Bors was ushered into the Great Hall at  dinner He was Lancelots cousin and had been spending a holiday at the castle of Corbin investigating the hauntings He had some news for Lancelot which he told him in a whisper after dinner  but unfortunately he was a misogynist and like most people of that sort he had the female failing of indiscretion He told the news to some of his bosom friends as well Soon it was all over the court The news was that Elaine of Corbin had given birth to a fine son whom she had christened Galahad   which was Lancelots first name as you remember  So this said Guenever when she next saw her lover alooe so this is why you lost your miracles It was all lies about your giving them to me What do you mean  Guenever began to breathe through her nose She was feeling as if there were two red thumbs behind her eyeballs trying to push them out and she did not want to look at him She was trying not to make a scene and she dreaded her heart She had shame and hatred of what she might say but she could not help saying it She was like a person swimming in a rough sea  You know what I mean she said bitterly looking away Jenny I wanted to tell you but it was too difficult to explain  I can understand the difficulty  It is not what you think  What I think she cried How do you know what I think I think what everybody would think  that you are a mean seducer just a liar you and your miracles And I was fool enough to believe you  Lancelot turned his head at each of her stabs as if he were trying to let them glance off him He looked on the ground to hide his eyes He had wide eyes which generally gave him an expression of fear or surprise  Elaine means nothing to me he said  Then she ought to do How can you say that she means nothing to you when she is the mother of your child When you tried to keep her secret No dont touch me go away  I cant go away when it is like this  If you touch me I shall go to the King  Guenever I was made drunk at Corbin Then they told me that you were waiting for me at Case and they took me to a dark room with Elaine in it I came away next morning  A clumsy lie  It is true  A baby wouldnt believe it  I cant make you believe it if you dont want to I drew my sword to kill Elaine when I found out  I will have her killed   It was not her fault  The Queen began plucking at the neck of her dress as if it were too tight for her  You are standing up for her she said You are in love with her and deceiving me I thought so all along  I swear I am telling the truth  She suddenly gave up and began to cry  Why didnt you tell me before she asked Why didnt you tell me you had a baby Why have you lied to me all the time I suppose she was your famous miracle which you were so proud of  Lancelot who also suffered from violent emotions began to cry in turn He put his arms around her  I didnt know I had one he said I didnt want one It was not my seeking  If you had told me the truth I could have believed you  I wanted to tell you but I couldnt I was afraid you would be hurt  It has hurt me worse like this  I know it has  The Queen dried her tears and looked at him smiling like a spring shower In a minute they were kissing feeling like the green earth refreshed by rain They thought that they understood each other once more  but their doubt had been planted Now in their love which was stronger there were the seeds of hatred and fear and confusion growing at the same time: for love can exist with hatred each preying on the other and this is what gives it its greatest fury  16 In the castle of Corbin the child Elaine was making ready for her journey She was coming to capture Lancelot from Guenever an expedition of which everybody except herself could feel the pathos She had no weapons to fight with and did not know how to fight She was quite without character Lancelot did not love her And she was in the yet more hopeless position of loving him She had nothing to oppose against the Queens maturity except her own immaturity and humble love nothing except the fat baby which she was carrying to its father  a baby which was to him only the symbol of a cruel trick It was an expedition like that of an army without weapons against an impregnable fortress an army which at the same time had its hands tied behind its back Elaine with an artlessness which could only be explained by the fact that she had spent most of her life in the seclusion of her magic cauldron had decided to meet Guenever on her own ground She had ordered gowns of the  utmost magnificence and sophistication  and in these which would only make her look all the more stupid and provincial she was going to Camelot to fight her battle with the English Queen  If Elaine had not been Elaine she might have taken Galahad as her weapon Pathos and proprietorship rightly applied to a nature like Lancelots might have been successful in binding him But Elaine was not clever did not understand the attempt to bind her hero She took Galahad because she adored him She took him only because she did not want to be parted from her baby and because she wanted to show him off to his father and partly because she wanted to compare the faces It was a year since she had set eyes on the man for whom her child mind lived  Lancelot while Elaine was planning his capture remained with the Queen at court But he now remained without the temporary peace of heart which he had been able to invent for himself while the King was away In the Kings absence he had been able to drown himself in the passing minute  but Arthur was perpetually at his elbow now as a comment on his treachery He had not buried his love for Arthur in his passion for Guenever but still felt for him To a medieval nature like Lancelots with its fatal weakness for loving the highest when he saw it this was a position of pain He could not bear to be made to feel that his sentiment for Guenever was an ignoble sentiment for it was the profound feeling of his life  yet every circumstance now conspired to make it seem ignoble The hasty moments together the locked doors and base contrivances the guilty manoarvres which the husbands presence forced on the lovers  these had the effect of soiling what had no excuse unless it was beautiful On top of this stain there was the torture of knowing that Arthur was kind simple and upright  of knowing that he was always on the edge of hurting Arthur dreadfully although he loved him Then there was pain about Guenever herself the tiny plant of bitterness which they had sown or seen sown in each others eyes on the occasion of their first quarrel of suspicion It was a pain to him to be in love with a jealous and suspicious woman She had given him a mortal blow by not believing his explanation about Elaine instantly Yet he was unable not to love her Finally there were the revolted elements of his own character  his strange desire for purity and honour and spiritual excellence All these things working together with the unconscious dread of Elaines arrival with his son broke his happiness without allowing him to escape He seldom sat down but strayed about with nervous movements picking things up and setting them down without looking at them walking to windows and looking out but seeing nothing  For Guenever the dread of Elaines arrival was not unconscious She had known from the first moment that Elaine was bound to come For her however as for all women the dreads were in advance of the male horizon Men often accuse women of driving them to unfaithfulness by senseless jealousy before there has been any thought of unfaithfulness on their own part Yet the thought was probably there unconscious and undetectable except to women The great Anna Karenina for instance forced Vronsky into a certain position by the causeless jealousy of a maniac  yet that position was the only real solution to their problem and it was the inevitable solution Seeing so much further into the future than he did she pressed towards it with passionate tread wrecking the present because the future was bound to be a wreck  So with Guenever Probably she was not over strained by Elaines immediate problem Probably she had no real suspicion against that side of Lancelot Yet with her prescience she was aware of dooms and sorrows outside her lovers purview It would not be accurate to say  that she was aware of them in a logical sense but they were present in her deeper mind It is a pity that language is such a clumsy weapon that we cannot say that a mother was unconscious of her baby crying in the next room  with the meaning that the mother somehow unconsciously knew that it was crying Facts of which Guenever was subconscious in this sense included the whole of the Arthur Lancelot situation most of the future tragedy at court and the grievous fact of her own childlessness  which was never to be remedied She said to herself that Lancelot had betrayed her that she was the victim of Elaines cunning that her lover was sure to betray her again She tormented herself with a thousand words of the same sort But what she felt to herself in the uncharted regions of her heart was a different matter Perhaps she was actually jealous not of Elaine but of the baby Perhaps it was Lancelots love for Arthur that she feared Or it may have been a fear of the whole position of its instability and the nemesis inherent in it Women know far better than men that Gods laws are not mocked They have more cause to know it  Whatever the explanation of Guenevers attitude the fruits of it were pain for her lover She became as restless as he was more unreasonable and much more cruel  Arthurs feelings completed the misery of the court He unfortunately for himself had been beautifully brought up His teacher had educated him as the child is educated in the womb where it lives the history of man from fish to mammal  and like the child in the womb he had been protected with love meanwhile The effect of such an education was that he had grown up without any of the useful accomplishments for living  without malice vanity suspicion cruelty and the commoner forms of selfishness Jealousy seemed to him the most ignoble of vices He was sadly unfitted for hating his best friend or for torturing his wife He had been given too much love and trust to be good at these things  Arthur was not one of those interesting characters whose subtle motives can be dissected He was only a simple and affectionate man because Merlyn had believed that love and simplicity were worth having  Now with a situation developing before his eyes which has always been notoriously difficult of solution  so difficult that it has been given a label and called the Eternal Triangle as if it were a geometrical problem like the Pons Asinorum in Euclid  Arthur was only able to retreat It is generally the trustful and optimistic people who can afford to retreat The loveless and faithless ones are compelled by their pessimism to attack Arthur was strong and gentle enough to hope that if he trusted Lancelot and Guenever things would come right in the end It seemed to him that this was better than trying to bring them right at once by such courses as for instance by cutting off the lovers heads for treason  Arthur did not know that Lancelot and Guenever were lovers He had never actually found them together or unearthed proofs of thek guilt It was in the nature of his bold mind to hope in these circumstances that he would not find them together  rather than to lay a trap by which to wreck the situation This is not to say that he was a conniving husband It is simply that he was hoping to weather the trouble by refusing to become conscious of it Unconsciously of course he knew perfectly well that they were sleeping together  knew too unconsciously that if he were to ask his wife she would admit it Her three great virtues were courage generosity and honesty So he could not ask her  Such an attitude to the position did not make it easier for the King to be happy He became not excitable like Guenever nor restless like Lancelot but reserved He moved about his own palace like a mouse Yet he made one effort to grasp the nettle  Lancelot said the King finding him one afternoon in the rose garden you have been looking wretched lately Is there anything the matter  Lancelot had snapped off one of the roses and was pinching the sepals These ancient roses it has lately been asserted were so constructed that the five sepals did actually stick out beyond the petals  just as they are represented to do in the heraldic rose  Is it anything asked the King hoping against hope about this girl who is said to have had your baby  If Arthur had left him alone with the first question and a silence to answer it in perhaps they would have had the matter out But Arthur was afraid of what might come in the silence and once he had given the lead of the second question the chance was gone Yes said Lancelot  You could not bring yourself to marry her I suppose I dont love her  Well you know your own business best Lancelot with an uncontrollable desire to get some of his misery off his chest by telling about it  and yet unable to tell the true story to this particular listener  began a long rigmarole about Elaine He began telling Arthur half the truth: how he was ashamed and had lost his miracles But he was forced to make Elaine the central figure of this confession and after half an hour he had unwittingly presented the King with a story to believe in  a story with which Arthur could content himself if he did not want to be conscious of the true tale This half truth was of great use to the poor fellow who learned to substitute it for the real trouble in later years We civilized people who would immediately fly to divorce courts and alimony and other forms of attrition in such circumstances can afford to look with proper contempt upon the spineless cuckold But Arthur was only a medieval savage He did not understand our civilization and knew no better than to try to be too decent for the degradation of jealousy  Guenever was the next person to find Lancelot in the rose garden She was all sweetness and reason  Lance have you heard the news A messenger has just arrived to say that this girl who is persecuting you is on her way to court bringing the baby She will be here this evening I knew she would come  We shall have to do our best for her of course Poor child I expect she is unhappy  It is not my fault if she is unhappy  No of course it isnt But people get made unhappy by the world and we must help them when we can  Jenny it is sweet of you to be kind about it  He turned towards her and made a movement to catch her hand Her words had made him hope that all would be well But Jenny took her hand away  No dear she said I dont want you to make love to me until she has gone I want you to be quite free  Free  She is the mother of your baby and she is unmarried We two cant ever be married I want you to be able to marry her if you would like it because that is the only thing which can be done  But Jenny    No Lance We must be sensible I want you to keep away from me while she is here and to find out whether you could love her after all It is the least that I can do for you  17 Elaine arrived at the yawning barbican and Guenever kissed her coolly You are welcome to Camelot she said Five thousand welcomes  Thank you said Elaine  They looked at each other with hostile smiling faces  Lancelot will be delighted to see you  Oh  Everybody knows about the baby dear There is nothing to be shy about The King and I are quite excited to see whether he will be like his father  It is kind of you said Elaine uncomfortably  You must let me be the first to see him You have called him Galahad have you not Is he strong Does he notice things  He weighs fifteen pounds the girl announced with pride You can see him now if you like  Guenever took hold of herself with an effort which was hardly noticeable and began fussing with Elaines wraps No dear she said I must not be so selfish as that You must rest after your long journey and probably Baby will have to be settled down I can come to see him this evening when he has had a sleep There will be plenty of time  But she had to see the baby in the end When Lancelot next met the Queen her sweetness and reason were gone She was cold and proud and spoke as if she were addressing a meeting  Lancelot she said I think you ought to go to your son Elaine is grieving because you have not been to see him  Have  you seen him Yes  Is he ugly He takes after Elaine Thank God I will go at once The Queen called him back  Lancelot she said taking a breath through her nose I am trusting you not to make love to Elaine under my roof If you and I are to keep apart until it is settled it is only fair that you should keep away from her I dont want to make love to Elaine You must say that of course And I will believe you But if you break your word this time it will be finished between us Absolutely finished I have said all I can say  Lancelot you have deceived me once so how can I be sure I have put Elaine in the next room to mine and I shall see if you go to it I want you to keep in your own room  If you like  I shall send for you some time tonight if I can get away from Arthur I will not tell you when If you are not in your room when I send for you I shall know that you are with Elaine  The girl was weeping in her chamber while Dame Brisen arranged the cradle for the little boy I saw him in the archery butts and he saw me too But he looked away He made an excuse and went out He has not even seen our baby  There there said Dame Brisen Lawks a mussy  I ought not to have come It has only made me more miserable and him too   Tis that there Queen  She is beautiful isnt she  The Dame said darkly: Handsome is as handsome does  Elaine began to sob helplessly She looked repulsive with her red nose as people do when they abdicate their dignity  I wanted him to be pleased  There was a knock on the door and Lancelot came in   which made her quickly dry the eyes They greeted each other with constraint  I am glad you have come to Camelot he said I hope you are well  Yes thank you  How is  the baby  Your lordships son said Dame Brisen with emphasis  She turned the cradle towards him and moved back so that he could see  My son  They stood looking down at the fresh thing helpless and only half alive They were strong as the poet sings and it was weak  one day they would be weak and it strong  Galahad said Elaine and she leaned over the wrappings making the foolish gestures and meaningless sounds which mothers delight to use when their babies are beginning to pay attention Galahad clenched his fist and hit himself in the eye with it an achievement which seemed to give pleasure to the women Lancelot watched them in amazement My son he thought It is a part of me yet it is fair It does not seem to be ugly How can you tell with babies He held out his right finger to Galahad putting it inside the fat palm of his hand which clutched it The hand looked as if it had been fitted to the arm by a cunning doll maker There was a deep crease round the wrist Oh Lancelot cried Elaine  She tried to throw herself into his arms but he pushed her off He looked at Brisen over her shoulder with fear and exasperation He made a wild senseless sound  and rushed out of the room Elaine unsupported sank down beside the bed and began to sob more than ever Brisen standing rigid as she had stood to bear Sir Lancelots glare looked at the closed door with an inscrutable expression  18 In the morning he and Elaine were summoned to the Queens chamber He for his part went with a kind of happiness He was remembering how Guenever must have pleaded illness on the previous evening so as to leave the Kings room Her lover had been sent for in the darkness The usual conniving hand had led him by the finger on tiptoe to the chosen bed In the silence forced on them by being next to Arthurs chamber but in passionate tenderness they had done their best to make it up Lancelot was happier today than he had been since the story of Elaine started He felt that if he could only persuade his Guenever to make a clean break with the King so that everything was in the open there might still be a possibility of honour  Guenever was stiff as if she were in a rigor and her face was drained white  except that there was a red spot on either side of her nostrils She looked as if she had been seasick She was alone  So said the Queen  Elaine looked straight in her blue eyes but Lancelot stopped as if he had been shot  So  They stood waiting for Guenever to speak or die  Where did you go last night  I   ï¿½  Dont tell me shouted the Queen moving her hand so that they could see a ball of handkerchief in it which she had torn to pieces Traitor Traitor Get out of my castle with your strumpet  Last night   said Lancelot His head was whirling with a desperation which neither of the women noticed  Dont speak to me Dont lie to me Go  Elaine said calmly: Sir Lancelot was in my room last night My woman Brisen brought him in the dark  The Queen began pointing at the door She made stabbing movements at it with her finger and in her trembling her hair began to come down She looked hideous  Get out Get out And you go too you animal How dare you speak so in my castle How dare you admit it to me Take your fancy man and go  Lancelot was breathing heavily and looking upon the Queen with a fixed stare He might have been unconscious  He thought he was coming to you said Elaine She had her hands folded together and watched the Queen passively  The old lie  It is not a lie said Elaine I could not live without him Brisen helped me to pretend  Guenever ran up to her with tottering steps She wanted to hit Elaine in the mouth but the girl did not move It was as if she was hoping that Guenever would hit her  Liar screamed the Queen  She ran back to Lancelot where he had sat down on a chest and was staring blankly at the floor with his head between his hands She caught hold of his mantle and began pushing or heaving him toward the door but he would not move  So you taught her the story Why couldnt you think of a new one You might have given me something interesting I suppose you thought the old stale stuff would do  Jenny   he said without looking up  The Queen tried to spit on him but she had never practised spitting  How dare you call me Jenny You are reeking of her still I am the Queen the Queen of England I am not your trull  Jenny    Get out of my castle screamed the Queen at the top of her voice Never show your face in it again Your evil ugly beastlike face  Lancelot suddenly said to the floor in a loud voice Galahad  Then he took down his hands from his head and looked up so that they could see the face she spoke of It had a surprised look and one of the eyes had begun to squint  He said more quietly: Jenny But he looked like a blind man  The Queen opened her mouth to say something though nothing came out  Arthur he said Then he gave a loud shriek and jumped straight out of the window which was on the first floor They could hear him crash into some bushes with a crump and crackle of boughs and then he was running off through the trees and shrubbery with a loud sort of warbling cry like hounds hunting The hullabaloo faded into the disstance and there was silence in the chamber with the women  Elaine who was now as white as the Queen had been but still held herself proud and upright said: You have driven him mad His wits must have been weak  Guenever said nothing  Why have you driven him mad asked Elaine You have a fine husband of your own the greatest in the land You are a Queen with honour and happiness and a home I had no home and no husband and my honour was gone too Why would you not let me have him  The Queen was silent  I loved him said Elaine I bore a fine son for him who will be the best knight of the world  Elaine said Guenever go away from my court  I am going  Guenever suddenly caught her by the skirt  Dont tell anybody she said quickly Dont say anything about what happened It will be his death if you do  Elaine freed the skirt  Did you expect I would  But what are we to do cried the Queen Is he mad Will he get better What will happen Ought we to do something What are we to say  Elaine would not stay to talk with her At the door however she turned with a trembling lip  Yes he is mad she said You have won him and you have broken him What will you do with him next  When the door was closed Guenever sat down She dropped her tattered handkerchief Then  slowly deeply primitively  she began to cry She put her face in her hands and throbbed with sorrow (Sir Bors who did not care for the Queen once said to her: Fie on your weeping for ye weep never but when there is no boot)  19 King Pelles was sitting in the solar with Sir Bliant two years later It was a fine whiter morning with the fields frosted no wind and a light fog which was not enough to confuse the pigeons Sir Bliant who had been staying the night was dressed in scarlet furred with miniver His horse and squire were in the courtyard ready to take him back to Castle Bliant but the two men were having their elevenses before he started Sitting with their hands spread to the splendid log fire they sipped their mulled wine nibbled pastry and talked about the Wild Man  I am sure he must have been a gentleman said Sir Bliant He kept doing things which nobody but a gentleman would do He had a natural leaning to arms  Where is he now asked King Pelles  God He knows He vanished one morning when the hounds were at Castle Bliant But I am sure he was a gentleman  They sipped and gazed into the flames  If you want to have my opinion added Sir Bliant lowering his voice I believe he was Sir Lancelot  Nonsense said the King  He was tall and strong  Sir Lancelot is dead said the King God be good to him Everybody knows that  It was not proved  If he had been Sir Lancelot you could not have mistaken him He was the ugliest man I have ever seen  I never met him said Sir Bliant  It was proved that Lancelot ran mad in his shirt and breeches until he got gored by a wild boar and died in a hermitage When was that Last Christmas  It was about the same time that my Wild Man ran away with the hunt Ours was a boar hunt too  Well said King Pelles they may have been the same person If they were it is interesting How did your fellow arrive  It was during the summer questing the year before last I had my pavilion pitched in a fair meadow in the usual way and I was inside it waiting for something to turn up I was playing chess I remember Then there was a frightful row outside and I went out and there was this naked lunatic lashing on my shield My dwarf was sitting on the ground rubbing his neck   the maniac had half broken it   and he was calling out for help I went to the fellow and said: Look here my good man you dont want to be fighting me Come now you lay down that sword and be a good chap He had got hold of one of my own swords you know and I could see that he was mad straightway I said: You ought not to be fighting old boy I can see mat what you need is a good sleep and something to eat And really he did look dreadful He was like a man who had been watching a passager for three nights His eyeballs were bright red  What did he say  He just said: As for that come not too nigh: for an thou do wit thou well I will slay thee Strange  Yes it was strange wasnt it That he should have known the high language I mean What did he do  Well I was only in my gown and the man looked dangerous I went back into the pavilion and did on my armour  King Pelles handed him another pasty which Sir Bliant accepted with a nod  When I was armed he went on with his mouth full I went out with a spare sword to disarm the chap I did not intend to strike him or anything like that but he was a homicidal maniac and there was no other way of getting the sword from him I went up to him like you do to a dog holding out my hand and saying: Theres a poor fellow: come now theres a good chap I thought it would be easy  Was it  The moment he saw me in armour and with a sword he came straight at me like a tiger I never saw such an attack I tried to parry a bit and I dare say I would have killed him in self  defence if he had given me a chance But the next thing I knew was that I was sitting on the ground and my nose and ears were bleeding He had given me a bufiet you know which troubled my brains  Goodness said King Pelles  The next thing he did was to throw away his sword and rush straight into the pavilion My poor wife was there in bed with no clothes on But he just jumped straight into bed with her snatched the coverlet rolled himself up in it and went fast asleep  Must have been a married man said King Pelles  The wife gave some frightful shrieks hopped out of bed on the other side jumped into her smock and came running out to me I was still a bit astonied lying on the ground so she thought I was dead I can tell you we had a fine to do  Did he sleep right through it  He slept like a log We managed to pull ourselves together eventually and the wife put one of my gauntlets down my neck to stop the nosebleed and then we talked it over My dwarf who is a splendid little chap said we ought not to do him any harm because he was touched by God As a matter of fact it was the dwarf who suggested that he might be Sir Lancelot There was a good deal of talk about the Lancelot mystery that year  Sir Bliant paused to take another bite  In the end he said we took him to Castle Bliant in a horse litter bed and all He never stirred When we got him there we tied his hands and feet against the hour when he would wake up I am sorry about it now but we could not chance it according to what we knew at the time We kept him in a comfortable room with clean clothes and the wife gave him a lot of nourishing food to build up his strength but we thought it best to keep him handcuffed all the same We kept him for a year and a half  How did he get away  I was coming to that It is the plum of the story One afternoon I was out in the forest tor half an hours questing when I was set upon by two knights from behind Two knights asked the King From behind Yes Two of them and from behind It was Sir Bruce Saunce Pitï¿½ and a friend of his King Pelles thumped his knee  That man he exclaimed is a public menace I cant think why somebody doesnt do away with him  The trouble is to catch the fellow However I was telling you about the Wild Man Sir Bruce and the other one had me at a considerable disadvantage as you will admit and I regret to say that I was compelled to run away  Sir Bliant stopped and gazed into the fire Then he cheered up  Ah well he said we cant all be heroes can we Not all said King Pelles  I was sore wounded said Sir Bliant discovering a formula and I felt myself faint Quite  These two came galloping with me all the way to the Castle one on either side and they kept hitting me all the time I dont know to this day how I got away with my life It was written in the Stones said the King We rode past the barbican loopholes hell for leather and it was there that the Wild Man must have seen us We kept him in the barbican chamber you know Well he saw us at all events and we found out afterwards that he broke his fetters with his bare hands They were iron fetters and he had them on his ankles also He wounded himself dreadfully doing it Then he came hurling out of the postern with his hands all bloody and the chains flying about him and he pulled Braces ally out of the saddle and took  his sword from him and walloped Bruce on the head so that he knocked him noseling clean off his horse The second knight tried to stab the Wild Man from behind  he was absolutely unarmed  but I cut off the fellows hand at the wrist just as he stabbed Then the both of them caught their horses and rode away for all they were fit They rode more than a pace I can tell you That was Brace all over  My brother was staying with me that year I said to him: Why ever have we kept this dear fellow chained up I was ashamed when I saw his wounded hands He is happy and gracious I said and now he has saved my life We must never chain him up again but give him his freedom and do everything we can for him You know Pelles I liked that Wild Man He was gentle and grateful and he used to call me Lord It is a dreadful thing to think that he might have been the great Dulac and us keeping nun tied up and letting him call me Lord so humbly  What happened in the end  He stayed quietly for several months Then the boar hounds came to the castle and one of the followers left his horse and spear by a tree The Wild Man took them and rode away It was as if he were excited by gentlemanly pursuits you know  as if a suit of armour or a fight or a hunt stirred something in his poor head They made him want to join in  Poor boy said the King Poor poor boy It might well have been Sir Lancelot He is known to have been killed by a boar last Christmas  I should like to know that story  If your man was Lancelot he rode straightaway after the boar they were hunting It was a famous boar which had troubled the hounds for several years and that was why the field was not on foot Lancelot was the only man up at the kill and the boar slew his horse It gave him a dreadful wound in the thigh riving him to the hough bone before he cut off its head He killed it near a hermitage with one blow The hermit came out but Lancelot was so mad with his pain and everything that he threw his sword at the man I heard this from a knight who was actually there He said there was no doubt about its being Sir Lancelot  he was ugly and all that  and he said that he and the hermit carried him into the hermitage after he had fainted He said that nobody could possibly have recovered from the wound and that in any case he saw him die What made him most certain he said about the Wild Man being a great knight was that when he was standing in his death agony beside the dead boar he spoke to the hermit as Fellow So you see there may have been a touch of sanity at the end  Poor Lancelot said Sir Bliant  God be good to him said King Pelles  Amen  Amen repeated Sir Bliant looking into the fire Then he stood up and shook his shoulders I shall have to be going he said How is your daughter I forgot to ask  King Pelles sighed and stood up also  She spends her time at the convent he said I believe she is going to be received next year However we are to be allowed to see her next Saturday when she comes home on a short visit  20 After Sir Btiant had ridden away King Pelles stumped upstairs to do some biblical genealogy He was puzzled about the Lancelot affair and interested in it on account of his grandson Galahad All of us have been driven nearly mad by oar wives and sweethearts but King Pelles was aware that there is a tough streak in human nature which generally prevents us from being quite driven He thought it eccentric of Lancelot to say the least to lose his reason over a lovers tiff  and he wanted to find out by looking up the Ban genealogy whether there had been a streak of lunacy in the family which could account for it If there were it might descend on Galahad The child might have to be sent to the hospital of Bethlehem which later ages were to call Bedlam There had been enough trouble without that  Bans father said King Pelles to himself polishing his spectacles and blowing dust off numerous works of Heraldry Genealogy Nigromancy and Mystical Mathematics was King Lancelot of Benwick who married the King of Irelands daughter King Lancelots father in his turn was Jonas who married the daughter of Manuel of Gaul Now who was the father of Jonas  When one comes to think of it there may have been a weak link in Lancelots mind This may have been the cupboard skeleton we noticed ten years ago at the back of the small boys head as he turned the kettle hat to and fro in the Armoury of Beowick Castle ï¿½   Nacien said King Pelles Drat this Nacien There seem to be two of him  He had got back through Lisais Hellias le Grose Nacien the Hermit  from whom Lancelot probably inherited his visionary tendency  and Nappus to a second Nacien who if he existed would quite upset the Kings theory that Lancelot was but the eighth degree from Our Lord As a matter of fact nearly all hermits seemed to be called Nacien in those days  Drat him repeated the King and he glanced out of the window to see what the noise was about in the street outside the castle  A Wild Man  there seemed to be a lot of them about this morning  was being run through Corbin by the villagers who had once gone out to welcome Lancelot He was naked as thin as a ghost and he ran along with his hands over his head to protect it The small boys running all round him were throwing turfs at him He stopped every now and then and caught one of the boys and threw him over the hedge This only made the boys throw stones King Pelles could clearly see the blood running over his high cheek bones and the sunken cheeks and the hunted eyes and the blue shadows between bis ribs He could also see that the man was making for the castle  In the castle yard when King Pelles had gone dot and carry downstairs there was quite a crowd of castle folk standing round the Wild Man in admiration They had lowered the  portcullis to keep the village boys out and they were disposed to treat the fugitive with kindness  Look at his wounds said one of the squires Look at that great scar there Perhaps he was a knight errant before he went mad and so we ought to give him courtesy  The Wild Man stood in the middle of the ring while the ladies giggled and the pages pointed He hung his head and stood motionless without speaking waiting for what was to be done to him next  Perhaps he is Sir Lancelot  There was a great laugh at this  No but seriously It was never exactly proved that Lancelot is dead  King Pelles went right up to the Wild Man and looked into his face He had to stoop sideways to do this  Are you Sir Lancelot he asked  The emaciated dirty bearded facet its eyes never even blinked  Are you repeated the King But there was no answer from the dummy He is deaf and dumb said the King We will keep him as a jester He looks funny enough I must say Somebody get the man some clothes  you know comic clothes  and put him to sleep in the pigeon house Give him some clean straw  The dummy suddenly lifted both its hands and let out a roar which made everybody start back The King dropped his spectacles Then it lowered its hands again and stood sheepishly so that the people gave a nervous giggle  Better lock him in said the King wisely Safety first And do not hand him his food   throw it to him Cant be too careful  So Sir Lancelot was led away to the pigeon house to be King Pelles fool  and there he was locked in and fed by throwing and lodged on clean straw  When the Kings nephew a boy called Castor came to be knighted on the following Saturday  this was the ceremony which Elaine was coming home to attend  there was gaiety in the castle The King who was addicted to festivals and ceremonials of all sorts celebrated the occasion royally by presenting a new gown to every man on the estate He also celebrated it regrettably by making too generous a use of the cellars over which Dame Brisens husband presided Wossle cried the King  Drink hail replied Sir Castor who was on his best behaviour  Everybody gotter gown shouted the King Yes thank you Your Majesty replied the attendants Sure  Quite sure Your Majesty Thas alri then Goo ole gown And the King wrapped himself in his own gown with great affection He was a different man on occasions like this  Everybody wants to thank Your Majesty very much for his generous present Notter tall  Three cheers for King Pelles Hurrah hurrah hurrah  Warrabout the fool inquired the King suddenly Fool gotter gown Wheres the pore fool  There was a silence at this for nobody had remembered to put a gown aside for Sir Lancelot  Notter gown Nottergotter gown cried the King Fesha fool at once  Sir Lancelot was fetched from the pigeon house for the royal favour He stood still in the torchlight with some straws in his beard a pitiful figure in his jesters patchwork  Pore fool said the King sadly Pore fool Here have mine  And in spite of all remonstrances and advices to the contrary King Pelles struggled out of his costly robe which he popped over Lancelots head  Lettim loose cried the King Givim holly holly day Karnkeepamanlocktupforever  Sir Lancelot standing upright in the grand dress looked strangely stately in the Great Hall If only his beard had been trimmed  our clean shaven generation has forgotten what a difference the trimming of a beard can make  if only he had not starved away to a skeleton in the cell of the poor hermit after the boar hunt  if only he had not been rumoured to be dead  but even as it was a sort of awe came into the Hall The King did not notice it With measured tread Sir Lancelot walked back to his pigeon loft and the house carls made an avenue for him as he went  21 Elaine had done the ungraceful thing as usual Guenever in similar circumstances would have been sure to grow pale and interesting  but Elaine had only grown plump She walked in the castle garden with her companions dressed in the white clothes of a novice and there was a clumsy action in her walk Galahad now three years old walked with her holding hands  It was not that Elaine was going to be a nun because she was desperate She was not going to spend the rest of her life acting the cinema nun A woman can forget a lot of love in two years  or at any rate she can pack it away and grow accustomed to it and hardly remember it more than a business man might remember an occasion when by ill lack he failed to make an investment which would have made him a millionaire  Elaine was going to leave her son and become the bride of Christ because she saw that this was the only thing to do It was not a dramatic thing and perhaps it was not very reverent    but she kaew that she would never again love any human person as she had loved her dead knight So she was giving in She could not tack against the wind any longer  She was not moping for Lancelot nor did she weep for him on her pillow She hardly ever thought of him He had worn a place for himself in some corner of her heart as a sea shell always boring against the rock might do The making of the place had been her pain But now the shell was safely in the rock It was lodged and ground no longer Elaine walking in the garden with her girls thought only about the ceremony at which Sir Castor had been knighted and whether there would be enough cakes for the feast and that Galahads stockings needed mending  One of the girls who had been playing a kind of ball game to keep warm  the same game as Nausicaa was playing when Ulysses arrived  came running back to Elaine from the shrubbery by the well Her ball had taken her in that direction  There is a Man she whispered much as if it had been a rattlesnake There is a Man sleeping by the well  Elaine was interested  not because it was a man nor because the girl was frightened but because it was unusual to sleep out of doors in January Hush then said Elaine We will go and see The plump novice in the white clothes who tiptoed over to Lancelot the homely girl going composedly towards him with a round face which had stubbornly refused to accept the noble traces of grief the young matron who had been thinking about Galahads mending  this person was not conscious of vulnerability or needs She went over calmly and innocently busy about quite different concerns like the thoughtless rabbit who goes hop and  nibble along the accustomed path But the wire loop tightens suddenly  Elaine recognized Lancelot in two heartbeats The first beat was a rising one which faltered at the top The second one caught up with it picked its momentum from the crest of the wave and both came down together like a rearing horse that falls  Lancelot was stretched out in his knightly gown Sir Bliant in remarking that gentlemanly things seemed to stir something in his head had noticed truly Moved by the gown by some strange memory of miniver and colour the poor Wild Man had gone from the Kings table to the well There alone in the darkness without a mirror he had washed his face He had swilled out his eye sockets with bony knuckles With a currycomb and a pair of shears from the stables he had tried to arrange his hair  Elaine sent her women away She gave Galahads hand to one of them and he went without protest He was a mysterious child  Elaine knelt down beside Sir Lancelot and looked at him She did not touch him or cry She lifted her hand to stroke his thin one but thought better of it She squatted on her hams Then after a long time she did begin to cry  but it was for Lancelot for his tired eyes smoothed in sleep and for the white scars on his hands  Father said Elaine if you dont help me now nobody ever can  What is it my dear asked the King I have a headache  Elaine paid no attention  Father I have found Sir Lancelot  Who  Sir Lancelot  Nonsense said the King Lancelot was killed by a boar  He is asleep in the garden  The King suddenly pulled himself out of his chair of state  I knew it all along he said Only I was too stupid to know It is the Wild Man Obviously  He reeled a little and put his hand to his head  Leave this to me said the King You let me deal I know exactly what to do Butler Brisen Where the devil has everybody gone to Hi Hi Oh there you are Now butler you go and fetch your wife Dame Brisen and get two other men that we can trust Let me see Get Humbert and Gurth Where did you say he was Asleep by the well said Elaine quickly Quite So everybody must be told to keep out of the rose garden Do you hear butler All people are to avoid that none may be in the way where the King will come And get a sheet A strong sheet We shall have to carry him in it by the four corners And get the tower room ready Tell Brisen to air the bedclothes Better have a feather bed Light a fire and fetch the doctor Tell him to look up Madness in Bartholomews Anglicus Oh and you had better get some jellies made and things like that In the heaviness of his sleep we shall have to put fresh garments on him  The next time he woke they could see that his eyes were clear But he was evidently in a pitiful state of mind He was relying on them to save him  The third time he woke he said: O Lord Jesus how did I get here  They said the usual things about resting now and not talking till he was stronger and so forth The doctor waved his hand to the Royal Orchestra who immediately struck up with Jesu Christes Milde Moder  since Dr Bartholomews book had recommended that madmen should be gladded with instruments Everybody watched hopefully to see the effect but Lancelot grabbed the Kings hand and cried in anguish: For Gods sake my lord tell me how I came here  Elaine put her band on his forehead and made him lie down  You came like a madman she said and nobody knew who you were You have been having a breakdown Lancelot turned his puzzled eyes on her and smiled nervously  I have been making a fool of myself he said Later he asked: Did many people see me while I was mad  22 Lancelots body revenged itself on his mind He lay in bed for a fortnight in the airy bedroom with an ache in every bone while Elaine kept herself outside the room She had him at her mercy and could have nursed him day and night But there was something in her heart   either decency or pride or generosity or humility or the determination not to be a cannibal  which spared him She visited him not more than once a day and thrust nothing on him  One day he stopped her as she was going out He was sitting up in a day gown and his hands lay still in his lap  Elaine he said I suppose I ought to be making plans  She waited for her sentence  I cannot stay here for ever he said  You know you will be welcome as long as you like  I cannot go back to court  Elaine remarked with hesitation: My father would give you a castle if you like and we   could live there together  He looked at her and looked away  Or you could have the castle  Lancelot took her hand and said: Elaine I dont know what to say I cant very well say anything  I know you dont love me  Do you think we should be happy then  I only know when I shall be unhappy  I dont want you to be unhappy But there are different ways of being that Dont you think it might turn out that you would be more unhappy if we lived together  I should be the happiest woman in the world  Look Elaine our only hope is to speak plainly even if it sounds horrible You know that I dont love you and that I do love the Queen It is an accident which has happened and it cant be changed Things do happen like that: I cant alter it And you have trapped me twice If it had not been for you I should still be at court Do you think we could ever be happy living together like that  You were my man said Elaine proudly before you were ever the Queens He passed a hand over his eyes Do you want to have a husband on those terms There is Galahad said Elaine They sat side by side looking into the fire She did not cry or bid for pity  and he knew she was sparing him these things  He said with difficulty: I will stay with you Elaine if you want me to I dont understand why you should want it I am fond of you very fond of you I dont know why after what has happened I dont want you to be hurt But Elaine  I cant marry you I dont mind  It is because  it is because marriage is a contract I  I have always been proud of my Word And if I do not  and if I have not that feeling for you  hang it Elaine I am under no obligation to marry you when it was you who tricked me  No obligation  Obligation exclaimed Lancelot with a wry face He threw the word into the fire as if it had a bad taste I must be sure that you understand and that I am not cheating you I will not marry you because I do not love you I did not start this and I cant give you my freedom: I cant promise to stay with you for ever I dont want you to accept these terms Elaine: they are humiliating ones They are dictated by the circumstances If I were to say anything else it would be lies and things would be worse    He broke off and hid his head in his hands I dont understand he said I am trying to do my best  Elaine said: Under any terms you are my good and gracious lord  King Pelles gave them a castle which was already known to Sir Lancelot The Kings tenant Sir Bliant had to move out to make room for them  which he did the more readily when he knew that he was obliging the Wild Man who had saved his life  Is he Sir Lancelot asked Bliant  No said King Pelles He is a French knight who calls himself the Chevalier Mai Fet I told you I was right about Sir Lancelot being dead  It had been arranged that Lancelot was to live incognito   because if it were allowed to get about that he was still living and lodged at Bliant Castle there would only be a hue and cry for him from the court  Bliant Castle had such a fine moat that it was practically an island The only way to get to it was by boat from a barbican on the land side and the castle itself was surrounded by a magic fence of iron probably a sort of cheval de frise Ten knights were appointed to serve Lancelot there and twenty ladies to serve Elaine She was wild with joy  We will call it the Joyous Island she said We shall be so happy there And Lance  he flinched when she called him by the pet name  I want you to have your hobbies We must have tournaments and hawking and plenty of things to do You must invite people to stay so that we can have company I promise I wont be jealous of you Lance and I wont try to live  in your pocket Dont you think we might have a happy time if we are careful Dont you think the Joyous Isle would be a lovely name  Lancelot cleared his throat and said: Yes it would be an excellent one  You must have a new shield made for you so that you can go on with your tournaments without being recognized What sort of blazon will you have  Anything said Lancelot We can arrange that later The Chevalier Mai Fet What a romantic name What does it mean  You could make it mean several things The Ugly Knight would be one meaning or the Knight Who Has Done Wrong  He did not tell her that it could also mean the Ill Starred Knight  the Knight with a Curse on Him I dont think you are ugly  or wrong Lancelot pulled himself together He knew that it would be most unfair to stay with Elaine if he were going to mope about it or to do the Grand Renunciation  but on the other hand it was empty work to pretend  That is because you are a darling he said He kissed her quickly and clumsily to cover the crack in the word But Elaine noticed it  You will be able to attend to Galahads education personally she said You will be able to teach him all your tricks so that he grows up to be the greatest knight in the world  He kissed her again She had said If we are careful and she was trying to be careful He felt pity for her trying and gratitude for the decency of her mind He was like a distracted man doing two things at once one of them important and the other unimportant He felt a duty to the unimportant one But it is always embarrassing to be loved And he did not like to accept Elaines humility because of his opinion of himself  The morning when they were to set out for Bliant arrived and the newly made knight Sir Castor stopped Lancelot in the Hall He was only seventeen  I know you are calling yourself the Ill Made Knight said Sir Castor but I think you are Sir Lancelot Are you  Lancelot took the boy by the arm  Sir Castor he said do you think that is a knightly question Suppose I were Sir Lancelot and was only calling myself the Chevalier Mai Fet  dont you think I might have some reasons for doing that reasons which a gentleman of lineage ought to respect  Sir Castor blushed very much and knelt on one knee I wont tell anybody he said Nor did he  23  The spring vame slowly the new menage settled down and Elaine arranged a tournament for her cavalier There was to be a prize of a fair maid and a jerfalcon  Five hundred knights came from all parts of the kingdom to compete in the tournament  but the Chevalier Mai Fet knocked down anybody who would stand up to him with a kind of absent minded ferocity and the thing was a failure The knights went away puzzled and frightened Not a single person had been killed  he spared everybody indifferently as soon as he had knocked them down  and by the Chevalier at any rate not a single word had been spoken The defeated knights jogging home with their bruises missed the conviviality which usually happened on tournament evenings wondered who the taciturn champion could be and talked superstitiously among thelmselves Elaine smiling bravely until the last of them had gone went up to her room and cried Then she dried her eyes and set out to find her lord He had vanished as soon as the fighting was over for he had got into the habit of going away by himself at sunset every evening  she did not know where  She found him on the battlements in a blaze of gold Their shadows and the shadow of the tower on which they stood and all the spectres of the burning trees stretched over the parkland in broad strips of indigo He was looking towards Camelot with desperate eyes His new shield with the blazon of his incognito was propped in front of him The cognizance was of a silver woman on a sable field with a knight kneeling at her feet  In her simplicity Elaine had been delighted by the compliment on the shield She had never been clever Now she realized for the first time that the silver woman was crowned She stood helplessly wondering what she could do  but there was nothing she could do Her weapons were blunt ones of soft metal She could only use patience and self restraint poor tools when matched against the heartfelt mania of love to which the ancient race was martyred  One morning they were sitting on a green bank at the edge of the lake Elaine was doing embroidery while Lancelot watched his son Galahad a priggish mute little boy was playing some private game with his dolls  to which he remained attached long after most boys would have taken to soldiers Lancelot had carved two knights in armour for him out of wood They were mounted on wheeled horses from which they were detachable and they held their spears in fewter By pulling the horses towards each other with strings tied to the platform on which they stood the knights could be made to tilt They could be made to knock each other out of the saddle Galahad did not care for them at all but played with a rag doll which he called the Holy Holy Gwyneth will ruin that sparrow hawk remarked Lancelot  They could see one of the castle gentlewomen coming towards them at a great pace with the sparrow hawk on her fist Her haste had excited the hawk which was bating continuously   but Gwyneth paid no attention to it beyond giving it an occasional angry shake  What is the matter Gwyneth  Oh my lady there are two knights waiting beyond the water and they say they have come to tilt with the Chevalier  Tell them to go away said Lancelot Say I am not at home  But sir the porter has told them the way to the boat and they are coming over one at a time They say they wont both come but the second will come if you beat the first He is in the boat already  He got up and dusted his knees  Tell him to wait in the tilt yard he said I will be twenty minutes  The tilt yard was a long sanded passage between the walls with a tower at each end It had galleries looking down on it from the walls like a racquets court and was open to the sky Elaine and the domestics sat in these galleries to watch and the two knights fought beneath them for a long time The tilting was even  each of them had a fall   and the sword play lasted for two hours At the end of this time the strange knight cried: Stop  Lancelot stopped at once as if he were a farm labourer who had been given permission to knock off for his dinner He stuck his sword in the ground as if it were a pitchfork and stood patiently He had indeed only been working with the quiet patience of a farm hand He had not been trying to hurt his opponent  Who are you asked the stranger Please tell me your name I have never met a man like you  Lancelot suddenly lifted both gauntlets to his helm as if he were trying to bury in them the face which was already hidden and said miserably: I am Sir Lancelot Dulac  What  I am Lancelot Degalis  Degalis threw his sword against the stone wall with a clang and began running back towards the tower by the moat His iron feet threw echoes down the yard He unlaced and tossed away his helm as he ran When he had reached the portcullis of the gate house he put his hands to his mouth and shouted with all his might: Ector Ector It is Lancelot Come over Immediately he was running back towards his friend Lancelot My dear dear fellow I was sure it was you I was sure it was you  He began fumbling with the laces trying to get the helm off with clumsy fingers He snatched off his own gauntlets and hurled them too with a clash against the wall He could hardly wait to see Sir Lancelots face Lancelot stood still like a tired child being undressed  But what have you been doing Why are you here It was feared that you were dead  The helm came off and went to join the rest of the discards  Lancelot  Did you say that Ector was with you Yes it is your brother Ector We have been looking for you for two years Oh Lancelot I am glad to see you You must come in he said and refresh yourselves But what have you been doing all this time Where have you been  hidden The Queen sent out three knights to search for you at the beginning In the end there were twenty three of us It must have cost her twenty thousand pounds  I have been here and there  Even the Orkney faction helped Sir Gawaine is one of the searchers  By this time Sir Ector had arrived in the boat  Sir Ector Demaris not King Arthurs guardian  and the portcullis had been raised for him He ran for the Chevalier as if he were to tackle him at football Brother  Elaine had come down from her gallery and was waiting at the end of the tilt yard She was now to welcome as she knew well the people who were to break her heart She did not interfere with their greetings but watched them like a child who had been left out of a game She stood still gathering her forces All her powers all the frontier guards of her spirit were being called in and concentrated at the citadel of her heart  This is Elaine  They turned to her and began to bow  You are welcome to Bliant Castle  24 I cant leave Elaine he said  Ector Demaris said: Why not You dont love her You are under no obligation to her You are only making yourselves miserable by staying together  I am under an obligation to her I cant explain it but I am  The Queen said Degalis is desperate She has spent a fortune looking for you I cant help that  It is no good sulking said Ector It seems to me that you are sulking If the Queen is sorry for what she has done whatever it was you ought to behave generously and forgive her  I have nothing to forgive the Queen That is just what I say You ought to go back to court and follow your career For one thing you owe it to Arthur: dont forget that you are one of his sworn knights He has been needing you badly Needing me  There is the usual trouble with the Orkneys What have the Orkneys been doing Oh Degalis you dont know how it does my heart good to hear the old names Tell me all the gossip Has Kay been making a fool of himself lately Is Binadan still laughing What is the news about Tristram and King Mark  If you are so keen about the news you ought to come back to court I have told you I cant  Lancelot you are not looking at this realistically Do you seriously think you can stay here incognito with this wench and still be yourself Do you think you can beat five hundred knights in a tournament without being recognized  The moment we heard about the tournament said Ector we came at once Degalis said: That is Lancelot or Im a Dutchman  It would mean said Degalis if you insist on staying here that you would have to give up arms altogether One more fight and you would be known all over the country For that matter I think you are known already  Staying with Elaine would mean giving up everything It would mean absolute retirement   no quests no tournaments no honour no love: and you might even have to stay indoors all day Yours is not an easy face to forget you know  Whatever it means Elaine is kind and good Ector when people trust you and depend on you you cant hurt them You could not treat a dog so  People dont marry dogs however  Damn it this girl loves me  So does the Queen  Lancelot turned the cap round in his hands  The last time I saw the Queen he said she told me never to come near her again  But she has spent twenty thousand pounds looking for you  He waited for some time and then asked in a voice which sounded rough: Is she well  She is absolutely wretched  Ector said: She knows it was her fault She cried a great deal and Bors told her she was a fool but she didnt argue with him Arthur is wretched too because the whole Table is upside down  Lancelot threw his cap on the ground and stood up  I told Elaine he said that I would not promise to stay with her: so I must  Do you love her asked Degalis cutting to the root  Yes I do She has been good to me I am fond of her  At their looks he changed the word  I love her he said defiantly  The knights had been staying for a week and Lancelot listening hungrily to their Table news was weakening every day Elaine sitting at the high table beside her lord at dinner lived in a flow of conversation about people whose names she had never heard and about events which she could not understand There was nothing to do except to offer second helpings which Ector would accept without interrupting the anecdote of the moment They leaned across her and talked and laughed and Elaine busily laughed too Every day Lancelot went to his turret at sunset  she had tiptoed away when she first found him there and he did not know it was a discovered rendezvous  Lancelot she said one morning there is a man waiting on the other side of the moat with a horse and armour A knight  No He looks like a squire  I wonder who it can be this time Tell the porter to fetch him across  The porter says he wont come across He says he will wait there for Sir Lancelot I will go and see  Elaine detained him as he went down to the boat Lancelot she said what do you want me to do with Galahad if you should go away Go away Who says I am going away Nobody has said so but I want to know I dont understand what you are talking about I want to know how Galahad is to be brought up Well I suppose in the usual way He will learn to be a good knight I hope But the whole question is imaginary That is what I wanted to know She detained him once more however Lancelot will you tell me one other thing If you should go away if you should have to leave me  would you be coming back  I have told you that I am not going away She was trying the meaning of her words as she made them like a man walking slowly over a bog and feeling in front of him as he went  It would help me to go on with Galahad  it would help me to go on living  if I knew that it was for something  if I knew that one day  if I knew that you would be coming back  Elaine I dont know why you are talking like this  I am not trying to stop you Lance Perhaps it will be best for you to go Perhaps it is a thing which has to happen Only I wanted to know if I should see you again   because it is important to me  He took her hands  If I go he said I will come back  The man on the other side of the moat was Uncle Dap He was standing with Lancelots old charger now two years older and all his accustomed armour neatly stowed on the saddle as if for a kit inspection Everything was correctly folded and strapped in the proper military place The habergeon was rolled in a tight bundle The helm pauldrons and vambraces were polished literally by weeks of polishing to that veneer or patina of light which is to be found only on things bought newly from the shop before they have been dulled by household  cleaning There was a smell of saddle soap mixed with the unmistakable personal smell of armour  as individual a smell as that which you get in the professionals shop on a golf course and to a knight as exciting  All Lancelots muscles made an empathic sortie towards the feeling of his own armour which he had not seen since he left Camelot His forefinger felt where the handle of his sword would use it for a fulcrum His thumb knew the exact weight in ounces which it would have to exert on the near side of the fulcrum The pad on the inside of his palm lusted for the gripe of the hilt His whole arm remembered the balance of Joyeux and wanted to wag him in the air  Uncle Dap looked older and would not speak He only held the bridle and displayed the gear waiting for the knight to mount and ride His stern eye as fierce as a goshawks waited on his charge He held out the great tilting helm silently with its familiar panache of heron hackles and the silver thread  Lancelot took the helm from Uncle Dap with both hands and turned it round His hands knew the weight to expect   exactly twenty two and a half pounds He saw the superb polish the fresh padding and the new mantling set behind It was of azure sarsenet hand  embroidered in gold thread with the numerous small fleur de lis of ancient France He knew at once whose fingers had done the embroidery He lifted the helm to his nose and sniffed the mantling  Immediately she was there  not the Guenever whom he had remembered on the battlements but the real Jenny in a different posture with every lash of her eyelids and every pore of her skia and every note of her voice and every articulation of her smile  He did not look back as he rode away from Bliant Castle  and Elaine standing on the barbican tower did not wave She watched him going with a still struck concentration like somebody who shipwrecked gets as much fresh water into the little boat as possible She had a few seconds left to make her store of Lancelot that must last her through the years There would be only this store and their son and a lot of gold He had left her all his money enough to bring a thousand pounds a year for life  in those days a huge sum  25 Fifteen years after leaving Elaine Lancelot was still at court The Kings relations with Guenever and her lover were much as they had always been The great difference was that everybody was older Lancelots hair which had already turned badger grey when he first came back from his madness as a fellow of twenty six was quite white Arthurs also was prematurely snowed  both mens lips were red in their silky nests of beard Guenever alone had contrived to keep the raven on her head She looked a splendid figure when she was forty  Another difference was that a new generation had come to court In their own hearts the chief characters of the Round Table felt the ardent feelings which they had always felt  but now they were figures instead of people They were surrounded by younger clients for whom Arthur was not the crusader of a future day but the accepted conqueror of a past one  for  whom Lancelot was the hero of a hundred victories and Guenever the romantic mistress of a nation  To these young people a sight of Arthur as he hunted in the greenwood was like seeing the idea of Royalty They saw no man at all but England When Lancelot rode by laughing at some private joke with the Queen the commonalty were amazed that he could laugh Look they would say to each other he is laughing as if he were a vulgar person like ourselves How condescending how splendidly democratic of Sir Lancelot to laugh as if he were an ordinary man Perhaps he eats and drinks as well or even sleeps at night But in their hearts the new generation was quite sure that the great Dulac did no such things  Indeed a lot of water had flowed under the bridges of Camelot in twenty one years They had been the years of building When they began they had been years of perriï¿½res and mangonels trundling along the rutty highways from one siege to another to hurl destruction over castle walls  of movable wooden towers on wheels going lumbering against recreant keeps so that the archers shooting down from the top of them could throw death into treacherous strongholds  of companies of engineers marching along in clouds of summer dust their picks and shovels on their shoulders to undermine revolted bartizans so that the great stones caved and fell tottering When Arthur had been unable to take a strong arm castle by assault he had caused tunnels to be dug under selected parts of the wall These tunnels being supported on beams of wood which could be burned away with fire at the proper moment had collapsed bringing the rubble filled baileys down on top of them  The early years had been times of battle in which those who insisted on living by the sword had been made to die by it They had been years lit by whole towersful of combatants roasting like so many Guy Fawkes  for the great objection to a pele tower as a stronghold was that it made a first class chimney  years ringing with the sound of battle axes thudding on battle axe proof doors  which were constructed by nailing the first ply of boards horizontally and the second ply vertically so that the wood could not be split along the grain  years illustrated by the shambling tumble of Norman giants  who were most conveniently dealt with by cutting off their legs first so that you could get a fair reach at their heads  and by the flicker of swords round helmets or elbow cops a flickering which in extreme cases was attended by such a shower of sparks as to make the struggling knights seem perfectly incandescent  Wherever you went during the first years every vista had been terminated by a marching column of mercenaries robbing and piling from the Marches  or by a knight of the new order exchanging buffets with a conservative baron whom he was trying to restrain from murdering serfs  or by a golden haired maiden being rescued out of some lofty keep by means of leather ladders  or by Sir Bruce Saunce Pitï¿½ riding a full wallop with Sir Lancelot coming deliverly after him  or by a few surgeons carefully ransacking the wounds of an unfortunate combatant and making him eat onions or garlic so that by smelling at the wound they could discover whether the intestines had been perforated or not When they had examined the wounds they dressed them with the oily wool from the udders of sheep which made a natural lanolin dressing Here would be Sir Gawaine sitting on his antagonists chest and finishing him off through the ventails of his helm with the long sharp poinard called the Mercy of God There would be a couple of knights who had suffocated thelmselves in their own helms during the course of a battle a misfortune which frequently happened in those days of violent exercise and small vents On one side would be a commodious gibbet set up by some old fashioned princeling to hang King Arthurs knights and the common Saxons who  trusted them  a gibbet perhaps nearly as sumptuous as that constructed at Montfaucon which could support sixty bodies depending like drab fuchsias between its sixteen stone pillars The humbler gallows had rungs on them like the footholds on telegraph poles so that the executioners could scramble up and down On another side would be a demesne so hedged about with mantraps in its shrubberies that none dared walk within a mile of it In front of you there might be a daffish knight who had been caught in a buck trap which swinging him into the air on the end of a stout branch released by the action of the trap had left him dangling helplessly between heaven and earth Behind you there might be a savage tournament or faction fight going on with all the heralds crying out Laissez les aller to ranks of chivalry who were about to charge  a cry which was exactly equivalent to the shout Theyre off which is still to be heard at the Grand National today  The World had been expected to end in the year one thousand and in the reaction which followed its reprieve there had been a burst of lawlessness and brutality which had sickened Europe for centuries It had been responsible for the doctrine of Might which was the Tables enemy The fierce lords of the Strong Arm had hunted the wild woodlands  only of course there had always been exceptions like the good Sir Ector of Forest Sauvage  till John of Salisbury had been forced to advise his readers: If one of these great and merciless hunters shall pass by your habitation bring forth hastily all the refreshment you have in your house or that you can readily buy or borrow from your neighbour: that you may not be involved in ruin or even accused of treason Children Duruy tells us had been seen hanging in trees by the sinews of their thighs It had been no uncommon sight to see a man at arms whistling like a lobster and looking like porridge because they had emptied a bucket of boiling bran over his armour during a siege Other spectacles even more dramatic have been mentioned by Chaucer: the smyler with the knyf under the cloke the careyne in the bush with throte y  corve or the colde deeth with mouth gaping upright Everywhere it had been blood on steel and smoke on sky and power unbridled   and in the general confusion of the times Gawaine had at last contrived to murder our dear old friend King Pellinore in revenge for the death of his own father King Lot  Such had been the England which Arthur had inherited such the birthpangs of the civilization which he had sought to invent Now after twenty one years of patient success the land presented a different picture  Where the black knights had hoved all brim and furious by some ford to take toll of anybody rash enough to pass that way now any virgin could circumambulate the whole country even with gold and ornaments upon her person without the least fear of harm Where once the horrible lepers  they called them Measles  had been accustomed to ramble through the woods in white cowls ringing their doleful clappers if they wanted to give warning or just pouncing on you without ringing them if they did not now there were proper hospitals governed by religious orders of knighthood to look after those who had come back sick with leprosy from the Crusades All the tyrannous giants were dead all the dangerous dragons  some of which used to come down with a burrr like the peregrines stoop  had been put out of action Where the raiding parties had once streamed along the highways with fluttering pennoncels now there were merry bands of pilgrims telling each other dirty stories on the way to Canterbury Demure clerics taking a days outing to Our Lady of Walsingham were singing Alleluia Dulce Carmen while the less demure ones were warbling the great medieval drinking song of thek own composition: Meum est propositum in taberna mori There were urbane abbots titupping along on ambling palfreys in furred hoods which were against the rules of their orders and yeomen in smart tackle with hawks on thek fists and  sturdy peasants quarrelling with their wives about new cloaks and jolly parties going out to hunt without armour of any sort Some were riding to fairs as great as that of Troyes others to universities which rivalled Paris where there were twenty thousand scholars whose ranks eventually provided seven popes In the abbeys all the monks were illuminating the initial letters of thek manuscripts with such a riot of invention that it was impossible to read the first page at all Those who were not doing the chi ro page were carefully copying out the Historia Francorum of Gregory of Tours or the Legenda Aurea or the Jeu dEchecs Moralist or a Treatise of Hawkynge  that is if they were not engaged upon the Are Magna of the magician Lully or the Speculum Majus by the greatest of all magicians In the kitchens the famous cooks were preparing menus which included for one course alone: ballock broth caudle ferry lampreys en galentine oysters in civey eels in sorrï¿½ baked trout brawn in mustard numbles of a hart pigs farsed cockintryce goose in hoggepotte venison in frumenty hens in brewet roast squirrels haggis capon neck pudding garbage tripe blaundesorye caboges buttered worts apple mousse gingerbread fruit tart blancmange quinces in comfit stilton cheese and causs boby In the dining halls the older gentlemen who had spoiled their palates with drinking were relishing those strange delicacies of the Middle Ages  the strong favours of whale and porpoise Their dainty ladies were putting roses and violets in their dishes  baked marigolds still make an excellent flavouring for bread and butter puddings  while the squires were showing their weakness for sheeps milk cheese In the nurseries all the little boys were moving heaven and earth to persuade thek mothers to have hard pears for dinner which were stewed in honey syrup and vinegar and eaten with whipped cream  The manners of the table too had reached a pitch of civilization far beyond our own Now instead of the plates made of bread there were covered dishes scented finger bowls sumptuous table cloths a plethora of napkins The diners thelmselves were wearing chaplets of flowers and graceful draperies The pages were serving the food with the formal movements of a ballet Wine bottles were being placed on the tables but ale being less respectable was being put beneath The musicians with strange orchestras of bells large horns harps viols zithers and organs were playing as the people ate Where once before King Arthur had made his chivalry the Knight of the Tower Landry had been compelled to warn his daughter against entering her own dining hall in the evening unaccompanied  for fear of what might happen in the dark corners  now there was music and light In the smoky vaults where once the grubby barons had gnawed thek bones with bloody fingers now there were people eating with clean fingers which they had washed with herb scented toilet soap out of wooden bowls In the cellars of the monasteries the butlers were tapping new and old ale mead port clarï¿½e dry sherry hock beer metheglyn perry hippocras and the best white whisky In the law courts the judges were dispensing the Kings new law instead of the fierce law of Fort Mayne In the cottages the good wives were making hot griddle bread enough to make your mouth water and putting fine turf on their fires regardless of expense and herding fat geese on the commons enough to support twenty families for twenty years The Saxons and Normans of Arthurs accession had begun to think of thelmselves as Englishmen  No wonder that the young ambitious knights of Europe flocked to the great court No wonder that they saw a king when they looked on Arthur a conqueror when they looked on Lancelot  One of the young men who came to court in those days was Gareth Another was Mordred  26  We dont see many arrows thrilling in peoples hearts nowadays remarked Lancelot one afternoon at the archery butts  Thrilling exclaimed Arthur What a splendid word to describe an arrow vibrating just after it has hit Lancelot said: I heard it in a ballad They went away and sat in an arbour from which they could watch the young people practising their shots  It is true said the King gloomily We dont get much of the old fighting in these decadent days  Decadent protested his commander in chief What are you so gloomy about I thought this was what you wanted  Arthur changed the subject  Gareth is shaping well he said watching the boy Its funny He cant be many years younger than you are yet one thinks of him as a child Gareth is a dear  The King put his hand on Lancelots knee and squeezed it affectionately  Some people might say that you are the dear he said so far as Gareth is concerned It has come to be quite a legend how the boy arrived at court anonymously so that bis own brothers didnt recognize him and how he worked in the kitchen and got nicknamed Beaumains when Kay wanted to be nasty and how you were the only person who was decent to him until he did his great adventure and became a knight  Well said Lancelot defensively his brothers hadnt seen him for fifteen years You cant blame Gawaine for that I am not blaming anybody I was just saying that it was nice of you to take notice of a kitchen page and help him along and knight him in the end But then you always were nice to people  It is strange how they come here said his friend I suppose they cant keep away Any boy with a bit of go in him feels that he has to come to Arthurs court even if it is to work in the kitchen because it is the centre of the new world That is why Gareth ran away from his mother She wouldnt let him come so he ran away and came incognito  Nonsense Morgause is a bad old woman  thats all you can say about her She forbade him to come to court because she hated you but he came for all that  Morgause is my half sister and I have hurt her badly It cant be nice for a woman to have all her sons going away to serve the man she hates Even Mordred her last  Lancelot looked uncomfortable He had an instinctive dislike for Mordred and did not like having it He did not know about Arthur being Mordreds father  for that was a story which had been hushed up in the earliest days before either he or Guenever came to court just as Arthurs own birth had been But he did feel that there was something strange between the young man and the King He disliked Mordred irrationally as a dog dislikes a cat  and he felt ashamed of the dislike because it was a confused principle of his to help the younger Knights  It must have hurt her worst of all when Mordred came pursued the King Women are always fondest of their last babies  So far as I can learn she was never particularly fond of any of them If she was hurt by their coming to court it was only because she hated you Why does she  Its a bad story I would rather not talk about it  Morgause added the King is a woman  is a woman of pronounced character  Lancelot laughed rather sourly  She must be he said from the way she is carrying on I hear she is making a dead set at Pellinores son Lamorak now although she is a grandmother  Who told you  Its all over the court  Arthur got up and walked three steps in agitation  Good God he exclaimed And Lamoraks father killed her husband Aud her son killed Lamoraks father And Lamorak is hardly of age  He sat down and looked at Lancelot as if he were afraid of what he might say next  All the same that is what she is doing  The King suddenly and vehemently asked: Where is Gawaine Where is Agravaine Where is Mordred  They are supposed to be on some quest or other  Not  not in the North  I dont know  Where is Lamorak  I think he is staying in Orkney  Lancelot if you had only known my sister  if you had only known the Orkney clan at home They are mad on their family If Gawaine  if Lamorak  O my God have mercy on my sins and on the sins of other people and on the tangle in this world  Lancelot looked at him in consternation  What are you afraid of  Arthur stood up for the second time and began talking fast  I am afraid for my Table I am afraid of what is going to happen I am afraid it was all wrong  Nonsense  When I started the Table it was to stop anarchy It was a channel for brute force so that the people who had to use force could be made to do it in a useful way But the whole thing was a mistake No dont interrupt me It was a mistake because the Table itself was founded on force Right must be established by right: it cant be established by Force Majeur But that is what I have been trying to do Now my sins are coming home to roost Lancelot I am afraid I have sown the whirlwind and I shall reap the storm  I dont understand what you are talking about Here comes Gareth said the King calmly suddenly and as if everything were over I think you will understand in a minute  While they had been talking a messenger in leather leggings had arrived at the butts The King had seen him out of the corner of his eye as he hastily sought Sir Gareth and handed him a letter He had watched the boy reading the letter once twice three times and later as he spoke confusedly with the man Now after handing his bow to the messenger without noticing that he was doing so Gareth was coming to them slowly  Gareth said the King  The young man knelt down and took the Kings hand He held it as if it were a banister or a life line He looked at Arthur with dull eyes and did not cry  My mother is dead said Gareth  Who killed her asked the King as if it were the natural question  My brother Agravaine  What  The exclamation was from Lancelot  My brother has killed our mother because he found her sleeping with a man  Keep quiet Lancelot please said the King Then to Gareth: What did they do to Sir Lamorak  But Gareth had not finished the first part of his story ï¿½  Agravaine cut off her head he said Like the unicorn  The unicorn  Please Lancelot  He killed our mother in her blood  I am sorry  I always knew he would said Gareth  Are you sure the news is true  It is true It is true It was Agravaine who killed the unicorn  Was Lamorak the unicorn asked the King gently He did not know what his nephew was talking about but he was anxious to help Is Lamorak dead  Oh Uncle It says that Agravaine found her naked in a bed with Sir Lamorak and he cut off her head Now they have hunted Lamorak down as well  Lancelot was less patient than the King because he knew fewer of the sorrows which had happened in the early days  Who were they he asked  Mordred Agravaine and Gawaine  So it comes to this said Sir Lancelot that your three brothers have first murdered King Pellinore  who would not willingly have hurt a fly  murdered him because he killed their father by accident in a tournament  then murdered their own mother in bed  and finally butchered Pellinores young son Lamorak for being seduced by their mother who was three times as old as he was I suppose they set upon him all against one  Gareth held the Kings hand tighter and began to droop his head   They surrounded him he said numbly and Mordred stabbed him in the back  27 Gawaine and Mordred came straight to Camelot from their foray among the Old Ones but Agravaine did not come with them They had quarrelled as soon as Lamorak was dead or rather as soon as they had found time to realize what had happened The murder of Queen Morgause had not been done on purpose Agravaine had done it on the spur of the moment   in his outraged passion he said   but they knew by instinct that it was from jealousy So they had raised the old charge against him that he was only a fat bully whose noblest employment was the killing of defenceless people or women and they had left him weeping after a furious scene Gawaine who now remembered all his adoration for their peculiar mother  an adoration which the queen witch had wished on each of her sons   rode to the Kings court in gloomy penitence He knew that Arthur would be furious about the way in which young Lamorak had been killed for the boy had been the third best knight of the Table and yet he was not ashamed of having killed him To his mind Lamorak deserved death like a felon because he and his father had injured the Orkney clan He knew that the whole court would look at him sideways on account of his mothers murder and how the old talk would be revived about that woman whom be had slain himself in temper when he was young Even this did not dismay him much But he was penitent and miserable because his own dear  Orkney mother was gone   he was only beginning to realize how it had happened   because he had hurt Arthurs ideal and because he was generous in his own heart He hoped that the King would hang him or send him into exile or punish him severely He went into the royal chamber with a sulky shame  Mordred walked into the room behind Gawaine as if nothing had happened He was a thin wisp of a fellow so fair haired that he was almost an albino: and his bright eyes were so blue so palely azure in their faded depths that you could not see into them He was clean shaven It seemed that there was no part of him which you could catch hold of neither his hair nor his eyes nor his whiskers Even the colour had been washed out of him it seemed so as to leave no handle Only in the skeletal pink face the brilliant eyes had crows feet round them  a twinkle which you could assume to be of humour if you liked or else of irony or merely of screwing up those sky blue pupils so as to look far and deep He walked with an upright carriage both ingratiating and defiant  but one shoulder was higher than the other He had been born slightly crooked  a clumsy delivery by the midwife  like Richard III  Arthur was waiting for them with Guenever and Lancelot on either hand  The burly red haired Gawaine knelt down clumsily on one knee He did not look at the King but spoke to the floor  Pardon  Pardon said Mordred also  but he kneeling beside his half brother looked the King between the eyes He had a non committal voice beautifully modulated  its words might have meant the opposite of what they said  You are pardoned said Arthur Go away  Go asked Gawaine He was not sure whether he was being banished  Yes go We can meet at dinner But go now Leave me please  Gawaine said roughly: The half of yon was done by sore ill fortune This time Arthurs voice was neither tired nor miserable  Go  He stamped his foot like a war horse pointing to the door as if he would throw them our of it His eyes flashed from his face like a sudden flame of green ash so that even Mordred got up quickly Gawaine was startled and stumbled out of the door in confusion but the crooked man recollected himself before he left He made a play actors bow a low luxurious simulacrum of humility  then straightening himself up he looked the King in the eye and smiled and went  Arthur sat down trembling Lancelot and Guenever looked at each other over his head They would have liked to ask why he was going to forgive his nephews or to protest that it was impossible to pardon matricides without damaging the Round Table But they had never seen Arthur in his royal rage before They felt that there was something in it which they did not understand so they held their peace  Presently the King said: I was trying to tell you something Lance before this happened  Yes  You two have always listened to me about my Table I want you to understand  We will do our best  Long ago when I had my Merlyn to help he tried to teach me to think He knew he would have to leave in the end so he forced me to think for myself Dont ever let anybody teach you to think Lance: it is the curse of the world  The King sat looking at his fingers and they waited while the old thoughts ran sideways across his hands like crabs  Merlyn he said approved of the Round Table Evidently it was a good thing at the time It must have been a step Now we must think of making the next one  Guenever said: I dont see what is wrong with the Round Table just because the Orkney faction chooses to get murderous  1 was explaining to Lance The idea of our Table was that Right was to be the important thing not Might Unfortunately we have tried to establish Right by Might and you cant do that  I dont see why you cant do it  I tried to dig a channel for Might so that it would flow usefully The idea was that all the people who enjoyed fighting should be headed off so that they fought for justice and I hoped that this would solve the problem It has not  Why not  Simply because we have got justice We have achieved what we were fighting for and now we still have the fighters on our hands Dont you see what has happened We have run out of things to fight for so all the fighters of the Table are going to rot Look at Gawaine and his brothers While there were still giants and dragons and wicked knights of the old brigade we could keep them occupied: we could keep them in order But now that the ends have been achieved there is nothing for them to use their might on So they use it on Pellinore and Lamorak and my sister   God be good to them The first sign of the fester was when our chivalry turned into Games Mania  all that nonsense about who had the best tilting average and so forth This is the second sign when murder begins again That is why I say that dear Merlyn would want me to start another thinking now if only he were here to help  It is something like idleness and luxury unmanning us   the strings have gone slack and out of tune  No: it is not that at all It is simply that I have kept a rod in pickle for my own back I ought to have rooted Might out altogether instead of trying to adapt it Though I dont know how  the rooting could have been done Now the Might is left with nothing to use it on so it is working wicked channels for itself  You ought to punish it said Lancelot When Sir Bedivere killed his wife you made him carry her head to the Pope You ought to send Gawaine to the Pope now  The King opened his hands and looked up for the first time  I am going to send you all to the Pope he said  What  Not exactly to the Pope You see the trouble is  as I see it  that we have used up the worldly objects for our Might  so there is nothing left but the spiritual ones I was thinking about this all night If I cant keep my fighters from wickedness by matching them against the world  because they have used up the world  then I must match them against the spirit  Lancelots eye caught fire and he began to watch the other man attentively At the same moment Guenever withdrew into herself She glanced quickly at her lover a covert glance then gave a new reserved attention to her husband  If something is not done went on the King the whole Table will go to ruin It is not only that feud and open manslaughter have started: there is the bold bawdry as well Look at the Tristram business with King Marks wife People seem to be siding with Tristram Morals are difficult things to talk about but what has happened is that we have invented a moral sense which is rotting now that we cant give it employment And when a moral sense begins to rot it is worse than when you had none I suppose that all endeavours which are directed to a purely worldly end as my famous Civilization was contain within thelmselves the germs of their own corruption What is this about sending us to the Pope I was speaking metaphorically What I mean is that the ideal of my Round Table was a temporal ideal If we are to save it it must be made into a spiritual one I forgot about God  Lancelot said the Queen in a peculiar voice has never forgotten  But her lover was too interested to notice her tone What do you intend to do he asked I thought we could start by trying to achieve something which would be helpful to the spirit if you see what I mean We have achieved the bodily things: peace and prosperity: now we lack work If we invent another bodily employment a temporal employment  mere empire building or something like that  we shall be faced by the same problem again probably worse as soon as it has been achieved But why cant we pull our Table together by turning its energies to the spirit You know what I mean by the spirit If our Might was given a channel so that it worked for God instead of for the rights of man surely that would stop the rot and be worth doing  A Crusade exclaimed Lancelot You are going to send us to the rescue of the Holy Sepulchre  We could try that said the King I hadnt exactly thought of it but it might be a good thing to try  Or we could look for relics cried his commander who was quite on fire If all the knights were looking for a piece of the True Cross they might not even need to fight  I mean if we were to go on a Crusade we should still be using force: we should be putting the Might into a channel against the infidels But if we really and truly banded the whole Table together to search for something which belonged to God himself why that would be infinitely worth doing  and although we should be busy there might be no need for fighting at all If it comes to that we neednt necessarily look for one thing alone Why if all our knights   one hundred and fifty men all specialists in questing like detectives  if all our knights were to turn their energies to the quest for things which belonged to God  why we might find hundreds and hundreds of things which would be of huge value The Round Table might have been positively invented and trained just for that object We might find some new gospels even The whole of Christianity might be helped by what we did Think of a hundred and fifty men all trained for the search And it is not too late to try The True Cross was found in 326 but the Holy Shroud was not discovered at Lirey until 1360 We might find the spear which killed Our Lord  I was thinking of that  We must look for manuscripts particularly  Yes  We must fare forth everywhere to the Holy Land to every place We shall be like my dear de Joinville  Yes  I think said Sir Launcelot this is the most splendid idea you have ever had  I am afraid of it said the King and this time it was his voice which sounded strange I thought in the night time that perhaps it was aiming too high If people reach perfection they vanish you know It may mean the end of the Table Supposing somebody were to find God  But Lancelots mind was not made for metaphysics He did not notice the change in Arthurs voice He began to hum to himself the great Crusaders hymn:  Lignum crucis Signum ducis Sequitur exercitus  We could search for the Holy Grail he cried triumphantly  It was at this moment that a messenger arrived from King Pelles Sir Lancelot was wanted he said to knight a young man at an abbey He was a fine young fellow seemly and demure as a dove He had been educated in a convent His name said the messenger was thought to be Galahad  Queen Guenever stood up and sat down She opened her hands and closed them again She knew that Sir Lancelot was going to his son by another woman  but she hardly minded that  28 If you want to read about the beginning of the Quest for the Grail about the wonders of Galahads arrival   Guenever in a strange mixture of curiosity envy and horror made a half  hearted attempt to vamp him  and of the last supper at court when the thunder came and the sunbeam and the covered vessel and the sweet smell through the Great Hall  if you want to read about these you must seek them in Malory That way of telling the story can only be done once The material facts were that the knights of the Round Table set out in a body soon after Pentecost with the immediate object of finding the Holy Grail  It was two years before Lancelot came back to court   and it was a lonely time for those at home Slowly those knights who had survived began to trickle back in twos and threes tired men bearing news of loss or rumours of success They came limping on crutches or leading spent horses which could carry them no longer or as one did who had lost a hand in battle carrying the one hand in the other All these men looked worn and confused Their faces were fanatical and they babbled of dreams Ships which moved of their own power silver tables on which strange Masses had been said spears which flew through the air visions of bulls and of thorn trees demons in old tombs kings and hermits who had been living for four hundred years  these figured in the rumours which filled the palace A count taken by Sir Bedivere showed that half the knights were missing They were presumed dead But all the time Sir Lancelot did not come back  The first reliable witness to return was Gawaine who reached the court in a black temper with his head bandaged He was the only one of the Orkney clan who had refused to learn English correctly and spoke in a Northern accent  almost an assumed one He still thought half in Gaelic He was defiant of the Southerners proud of his race  Blindness and Darkness on the Quest said Gawaine If I was eer upon a sleeveless errand it was yon  What happened  Arthur and Guenever like good children sat with their hands in their laps to listen to the stories Like children they were alert and eager sifting the truth as best they could  What happened is it Why what happened was that I wasted eighteen months and mair forbye in seeking footless for adventure  and ended up half deid with what ye name concussion May God presairve me from the Holy Grail whatever  Tell us from the beginning  From the beginning  He was surprised at his uncles interest  Tuts there is thing a bit to tell  TeU it all the same  Fetch some drink for Sir Gawaine said the Queen Sit down my lord You are welcome home Make yourself easy and tell the story  if you are not too tired  I am nae tired  but only for the ache within my heid I can relate the tale Thanks to you I will take whisky Maam Let see where did yon stour begin  The laird of the Orkneys sat down and tried to remember  When we left the castle of Vagon Ye mind we rode to Vagon in a body the first day and aye dispairsed next morn When we left thence I raid north west It didna signify which way Lancelot gave all men the hint the day before we scattered that auld King Pelles mentioned him a sacred dish one time in yin of his great castles He didna cleave importance tae it but told the people for its worth  The best half went in that deerection but I didna fash masel North west I raid He took a good swallow  The first tracks eer I happened on he said were Galahads For a conceited landless earl commend me to yon mannie  Yon laddie continued Sir Gawaine taking another gulp and warming to his work yon lily laddie is without discussion the utmost catamite which it had been my woe to smell the stink of through the world  he is Did he knock you down asked the King Na na Twas later I crossed his tracks at the outsetting Bred in a nunnery he went on furiously amidst a paircel of auld hens I have news at me about his pairsonal quest from various who have fronted him  the holy milksop with his hairt of a cold puttock But there the chiels an Englishman He wad be cut if he dared cross the Border  Unless he will have been cut already he concluded struck by the idea  What has Sir Galahad been doing wrong Thing a bit The mans a vegetarian and teetotaller and he makes believe he is a vairgin But I encountered with Sir Melias  ye ken Sir Melias is sairely maimed He telt me how yon Galahad behaved By some cause Melias had taken to the carl and asked permissions of the boy to go the one way with him I canna fathom why he would be doing sic a thing for the first one that had sought to go with Galahad was Uwaine Sir Galahad refused it Sir Uwaine wasna guid enough for him Well well he condescended to let Melias go however and he knighted him to boot My soul to the devil  to be knighted by a gomeril of eighteen When he had knighted Melias he quoth these verra words: Now fair sir says he sith ye be come of kings and queens now look that knighthood be well set in you for ye ought to be a mirror unto all chivalry What like do ye name it Aye a Southron snob The next act was that they twa came their ways to an adventure by the crossroads where Melias had a wish to ride toward the left Galahad said: It were better ye rode not that way for I deem I should better escape in that way than ye There was nae fause modesty abune the bonnie Galahad ye see Well Melias went left for a that   and he came by ill luck stricken through the hauberk at the hands of some mysterious knight wha rode upon him as Galahad foretold He was like to die  the broken truncheon in his side When the great Galahad found him wounded what does my mannie say but: Therefore it had been better to have ridden that other way A handsome chiel to say I told ye so to one  half deid Nor did he give him aid What happened to Sir Melias He said to Galahad: Sir let death come when it pleaseth him He drew the truncheon forth himself Melias is a bonnie knight and there is gladness on me that I may tell you he is still on life  Arthur said: After all Galahad is only a child He has growing pains perhaps I dont think we ought to judge him unkindly for little faults of social intercourse  Did ye ken that he has aye attacked his father and unhorsed him too Do ye ken that he has let his father kneel before him for to ask his blessing Do ye ken that peoples have been asking for to die in Galahads arms and that he has been granting them to do so as a favour Well perhaps it was a favour Diabhal exclaimed Gawaine and he buried his nose in the beaker  You are not telling us about yourself The first adventure which I suffered  indeed it wasna far from being the single one  fell at the Castle of Maidens It were best not tell of yon before the Queen  Arthur said rather coldly: My wife is not a baby or an imbecile Sir Gawaine Everybody knows about the custom of that Castle  Guenever said politely: They call it droit de seigneur in French  Well then indeed I came to the Castle of Maidens with Uwaine and Sir Gareth It was kept by seven knights whatever who insisted on the custom We found those seven outside the castle fully armed and had braw fight with them and slew them all When all was done twas manifest that Galahad had been before us Twas he had driven them forth at first without his killing eer a one of them and he himself was ben the castle at the very time All we had done was play the butchers part in finishing what wasna rightly ours Bad luck  Galahad rode his gait and wouldna speak with us The meaning was that we were sinful  he was blessed I dinna mind what happened after that  Did you ride on with Uwaine and Gareth  Nay we parted after Maiden Castle I rode all airts until I found a hermitage with its releegious man Ye ken the sort e wheen Salvationist The first demand he made was: I would wit how it standeth betwixt your God and you I asked that he should gie me lodging for the nicht Well he was host and priest as well so when he pressed me to confession I couldna well refuse He clattered waeful havers of the seven knights  they being the seven deadly sins said he  and told me calm as daylight that I was but a murdering man masel  Did he tell you asked the King with interest that it was wrong to kill people for any reason and especially when you were looking for the Grail  My soul to the devil he did so He preached that Galahad had aye expelled the seven knights without a slaughter and mentioned that the Holy Grail was nae for bloodshed  What else did he say  I canna mind When he had complimented me as I was telling ye he counselled I should make a penance Unless a body made his guid confession  and was absolvit fair   it would be bootless seeking for the Grail says he The ehiel was daffish An errant knight stands in a posture which should make the penance needless  as I shewed him  the like that manual labourers dinna fast in Lent I gave the man the lie and took my way forthwith I met with Aglovale and Griflet after that What then what then I rode with them four days I mind  Aye then we parted once again and darkness on me if I didna ride til Michaelmas without adventure  Troth is added Gawaine there are nae ventures to be found in England these late days The place is failed  Fetch Sir Gawaine another drink  When Michaelmas was gone and past I met with Ector Demaris He had been luckless like masel We rode to a wee chapel in the forest and slept there with a dram inside us  and each man had the one same dream that night It concairned a hand and arm in samite with a bridle and a candle in its gripe A voice made known that we twa were in need of them I encountered with a second priest thereafter wha said the bridle was for continence and the candle was for faith  it seems that Ector and masel were lacking these Ye mind how any man may twist a dream The next thing after was a piece of dour misfortune the like of that which has been on me all the while We came the twa of us upon my cousin Uwaine with his shield in cover  and didna recognize his blazon Ector conceded me the first fall with my cousin my ain kin The spear went fair through Uwaines chest There will have been a weakness in his brigandine Is Uwaine dead  Aye dead man It is the black ill happening that was on me  Arthur cleared his throat  I should have thought it was worse happening for Uwaine he said God rest him Perhaps it might not have been a bad thing if you had listened to that priest of yours at the beginning  I had nae wish to kill He was own cousin to the Orkneys And think ye that the southron prig him of the white shield had before refused to ride with him  Do you mean Galahad Was he bearing the vergescu Aye Galahad It wasna the vergescu He had laid hold upon a shield in some place which was to have belonged to Joseph Arimathea so he said The cognizance was argent a tau cross gules The argent was to signify the white of virgins we were let to know and the red cross was for the Grail I am from my tale  You had just killed Uwaine said Arthur patiently Ector and I rode on to one more hermitage and it was there the priest made known about the bridle in our dream This priest was vegetarian may I tell ye He gave the auld tale about murder hot and hot and was for pressing our repentance We made excuses and we rode out gait  Did he tell you that the reason why neither of you had any luck was because you were only looking for slaughter Aye did he He said that Lancelot was better man than us because he rarely killed his adversary  and in parteecular by cause he didna in this quest Also he said  that many other knights  Ector himself met twenty  were in the same case with us from their sins He said manslaughter was contrary to the quest We juist made speech with him and slipped away while he was talking yet  And then  We came upon a castle then Ector and I a bonnie tournament was forward We joined the attacking men  and had fine battle  and were at point to force our way inside   the tempers were a wee bit risen  when Galahad came up God the Almighty knows what ill wind brought yon mannie It seems he wasna for approving of such knights as fight for sport He joined the ither side and drove us forth the castle and he gave me this  Gawaine touched his bandage  Ector was not for fighting him he explained They were related But I fought none the less for that and small thanks with it He gave a blow which split my helm whatever and broke the iron coif  aye and it glanced off too killing my horse Yon was the end for me by Christ I was for bed daring one month and more  And then you came home  Aye home  You certainly seem to have been unlucky said the Queen  Unlucky  Gawaine looked into his empty beaker for a moment or two Then he cheered up  I slew King Bagdemagus he said Nae doot ye heard of yon I missed to tell ye in my tale  Arthur had been listening closely and turning over his own thoughts Now he made a movement of impatience  Go to bed Gawaine he said You must be tired Go to bed and think about it  29 The next person to get home was Sir Lionel one of Lancelots cousins Lancelot had one brother called Ector and two cousins called Lionel and Bors Lionel was in a temper rather like Gawaine but the object of his an noyance was not Galahad It was his own brother Bors  Morals said Lionel are a form of insanity Give me a moral man who insists on doing the right thing all the time and I will show you a tangle which an angel couldnt get out of  The King and Queen were sitting side by side as usual to hear the travellers story They had formed a habit of carrying the refreshments into the Great Hall with their own hands as soon as any knight got back so that they could hear the news while he ate The light fell on the  table between them  from a high stained window  so that their hands moved among plates and glasses which were rubies emeralds or pools of flame They were in a magic world of gems a glade under trees whose leaves were jewels  Has Bors been going in for morals  Bors always did said Lionel curse him Morals seem to run in my family Lancelot is bad enough to begin with but Bors beats him to a frazzle Did you know that Bors has only once committed the sexual act  Really  Yes really And so far as this Quest for the Holy Grail is concerned he seems to have been doing a sort of advanced course in Catholic dogma  Do you mean he is studying  Lionel relented a little He was fond of his brother in his heart but he had been through an experience which had embittered their relations Now that he could talk about it and had had time to think it over he was beginning to see the other side of the quarrel  No he said You musnt take me seriously Bors is a dear fellow and if ever there is to be a saint in our family it will be him He isnt bright in the head and he is a bit of a prig but his guesses are sometimes pure gold I believed God has been testing him during this quest and Im not sure that he has not come out trumps I tried to kill him  You had better begin your story at the beginning said Arthur or we shant understand how it goes along  My story is nothing I have been footling about like Gawaine being called a murderer by a few hermits Ill tell you the story of Bors because I come into it  God began Lionel has been making a trial of Bors I suppose It is as if he was going to be priested and they wanted to be sure if he was orthodox Do you know I think that where Gawaine and myself and Ector and all the rest of us went off the right line was when we didnt go to confession at the beginning Bors went the first day and he took a penance too He promised to eat nothing but bread and water and to wear a Garment and to sleep on the floor Of course he was not going to have anything to do with the ladies  but then he only once had Thats his trouble Well the first thing that happened after putting his life in order was that he began having visions He saw the pelican in her piety and a swan and a raven and some rotten wood and some flowers It all had to do with his theology and he did explain it to me but I cant remember The next thing which happened was that a lady begged him to rescue her from a knight called Sir Pridam He rescued the lady easily enough and had an opportunity to kill Sir Pridam Mark this He told me the story after our battle and he insisted that it was his first trial He said that he felt like a show jumper being put over bigger leaps each time and he was afraid that if he ever bungled a leap he would be sent back to the stable If he had killed Sir Pridam he would have been finished They would have put him out to grass again just as they did with Gawaine and the rest of us He said that nobody told him these things  the leaps suddenly appeared in front of him and it was as if there were somebody watching  somebody who would not help or hint but who just watched to see if  he would get over Well he didnt kill Pridam He only squealed at him to give in and hit his face with the flat of the sword until he yielded And that jump was safely done Do you think there can have been something against killing people in this quest King You know some sort of supernatural No  I think you are a wise man Lionel said the King even if you did try to kill your brother Go on with the story  Well the next trial was directly about me It was the reason why I tried to kill him Im sorry about it now I have only just realized Im sorry At the time I didnt understand  What was the second trial  Bors and I have always been fond of each other as you know This tiff is nothing We have always loved each other in our way and Bors was riding through the forest when he came face to face with two things One was me bound naked on a hackney with two knights riding on either side and flogging me with thorns The other was a virgin riding more than a pace with a knight galloping after her to have her maidenhead The two convoys were going in opposite directions and Bors was alone  Come to think of it remarked Sir Lionel ruefully I am unlucky about getting flogged with thorns I got it from Sir Turquine once before  Which party did Bors choose  Bors decided to rescue the maiden When I eventually asked him what the devil he meant by deserting his own brother at the time of our battle later on he explained that he had thought I was inclined to be a dirty dog  though fond of me  while the maiden was a maiden after all So he thought his duty was toward the better party That was why I tried to kill him  But now added Lionel I can see his point I can see it was his second trial and a difficult decision it must have been to make  Poor Bors I hope he was not too much of a prig about it  He was humble These trials just used to loom up in front of the old gossip and he would make a wild guess generally thinking that he had guessed wrong  and in the end he would come out bewildered and find that he had guessed right He sweated along doing the best he could  What was the third trial  They got worse as they went In the third trial a man came to him dressed as a priest and told him that there was a lady in a castle nearby who was doomed to death unless Bors made love to her This supposed priest pointed out that he had already sacrificed the life of his own brother   that was me  by wrongly choosing to help the maiden and that if he did not sin with the new lady now he would have a second life on his conscience I ought to have mentioned that the two knights left me for dead and Bors found me apparently dead and he had taken my body to an abbey for burial Of course I recovered later  Well the lady appeared in the castle  as stated by the feigned priest  and she confirmed the story She said that there was a magic which would make her die for love unless my brother was good to her Bors now realized that he must either commit mortal sin and save the lady or refuse to commit it and let her die He told me afterwards that he remembered some bits out of the penny catechism and a sermon which was once given when there was a mission at Camelot He decided that he was not responsible for the ladys actions while he was responsible for his own So he refused the lady  Guenever giggled  That was not the end of it The lady was dazzlingly beautiful and she climbed to the highest keep of her castle with twelve lovely gentlewomen and she said that if Bors would not stop being so pure they would all jump off together She said she would force them to do so She said that he only had to have one night with her  and why need it not be fun  for the gentlewomen to be saved All twelve of them shouted out to Bors and begged him for mercy and wept for dole  I can tell you my brother was in a quandary The poor things were so frightened and so pretty and he only had to stop being obstinate to save their lives  What did he do  He let them jump  Shame cried the Queen  Oh they were only a collection of fiends of course The whole tower turned up so down and vanished immediately and it turned out that they had been fiends all the time including the priest  I suppose the moral is said Arthur that you must not commit mortal sin even if twelve lives depend upon it Dogmatically speaking I believe that is sound  I dont know what the dogma is but I know it nearly turned my brothers hair grey  And a good right it had to What was the fourth trial if there was one  The fourth one was me and it was the last hurdle I revived at the abbey where he had left me to be buried and when I was well enough I rode to seek him out I am sorry about it now  by the way I shall have to ask your pardon for some of the things I did  but when you come to think of it it does seem a bit steep to be left by your own brother to be beaten to death What with taking ones meals off the mantelpiece and not understanding at the time about the things which were happening to Bors and knowing that just before I lost consciousness I had seen him leave me to my fate  well I admit that I was in a bitter frame of mind In fact I was murderous  I found Bors at a chapel in the forest and I told him at once that I was going to kill him I said: I shall do to thee as a felon or a traitor for ye be the untruest knight that ever came out of so worthy an house Bors refused to fight I said: If you dont fight I shall kill you as you stand Bors said that he couldnt fight his own brother of all people He said that he was not  even allowed to kill ordinary chaps on the Grail Quest so how could he kill his brother I said: I do not care what you are allowed to do or not allowed to do If you like to defend yourself I shall fight you: if not I shall kill you anyway I was furious Bors just knelt down and asked for mercy  I can see now he went on that it was right enough for Bors to do as he did He was after the Grail he was in the anti homicide squadron and I was his brother Also it was brave of him But I couldnt see it at the time I simply thought he was being obstinate and I knocked him feet upwards as he kneeled Then I drew my sword to cut off his head  Lionel sat in silence for a minute looking at the plate in front of him where there was a bright pool of ruby from the stained glass shaped like an egg  You know he said its all very well to take up with morals and dogmas so long as there is only yourself in it: but what are you to do when other people join the muddle I suppose it was clear enough for Bors to kneel down and let me kill him but the next thing was that a hermit came rushing out of the chapel and threw himself across my brothers body He said he was going to prevent me at all costs from becoming a fratricide I killed the hermit  Killed a defenceless man  I am desperately sorry King but it is true Dont forget that I was in a frightful rage and the fellow prevented me from getting at Bors and I am a plain man of my hands They were baffling me with a sort of moral weapon and I used my own weapon against it I felt that Bors was standing up to me in an unfair way and that this hermit was helping him I felt he was setting his will against mine If he wanted to save the hermit let him stop being obstinate and get up and fight If you see what I mean I felt that the hermit was his business not mine  Im afraid that I was simply in a passion admitted Lionel after a bit You know how you get I wanted to fight and I was going to have it I had said I would kill him if not and I was going to kill him You know how it is It is like the sulks  There was an uncomfortable silence  I had better finish my story he said awkwardly  Go on  Well Bors let me kill the hermit He just lay on the ground and asked for love I was more maddened than ever by this time partly by shame and I raised my sword to cut off my brothers head there and then  when Sir Colgrevance of Gore turned up He put himself between us and said fie on me for trying to shed my fathers blood That was the last straw with all the hermits blood round my feet so I just went for Colgrevance instead And in a few minutes I had him on the run  What did Bors do  Poor Bors What his feelings were at that moment I dont like to think There he was at his fence again you see and he only had to refuse it to save another life He had wasted the hermits apparently through obstinacy and now I was going to kill the innocent Colgrevance  who had tried to help him Colgrevance kept sobbing out to him too saying: Get up and help man Why are you letting me be killed for you   Passive resistance said Arthur with intense interest It is a new weapon But it seems difficult to use Go on please  Well I killed Colgrevance in fair fight I am sorry but I did Then I came back to Bors to finish the matter He held his shield over his head but would not struggle  What happened  God came said the boy solemnly He came between us and dazzled us and made our shields burn  There was a long pause while Arthur digested the first tidings of certain things which he had hoped or feared  You see said Lionel Bors prayed  And God came  I dont know exactly what happened but the sun was laming on our shields Something happened We suddenly stopped fighting and began to laugh I saw that Bors was an idiot and he kissed me and we made it up Then he told me his story as I have told you and sailed away in a magic ship covered in white samite Bors will find die Grail if anybody does find it and that is the end of my story  They sat silent finding it difficult to talk about spiritual matters until finally Sir Lionel spoke for the last time  It is all very well for Bors he said complainingly but what about the hermit What about Sir Colgrevance Why didnt God save them  Dogmas are difficult things said Arthur  Guenever said: We dont know what their past history was The killing didnt do any harm to their souls Perhaps it even helped their souls to die like that Perhaps God gave them this good death because it was the best thing for them  30 The third important arrival  was Sir Aglovale who came rather late in the afternoon when the rubies had left the table and climbed the wall He was a lad of less than twenty summers with a fine noble face and a sense of humour He was still in mourning for his Father King Pellinore  and he signified this by wearing a black sash on his shield arm At least they thought it was for King Pellinore As a matter of fact his mother had died as well since they last saw him He was also bringing news of the death of a sister  for nearly all of Pellinores family had been unfortunate  Is Gawaine here asked Aglovale Where are Mordred and Agravaine  He glanced about him as if he might actually find them in the Hall Above his head the coloured beam of light fell upon a small and primitive piece of tapestry  a picture of some knights in chain mail with nose guards on their painted helmets chasing a boar  Arthur said: Aglovale they are here My happiness is in your hands  I see  Are you going to kill them  I came to kill Gawaine first It seems queer after looking for the Holy GraiL  Aglovale you have every right to try for reveage against the Orkneys and I will mot stop you if you do try But I want you to know what you are doing Your father killed their father and your brother slept with their mother No dont explain about it  let me remind you of the facts Then the Orkneys killed your father and brother Now you are going to kill some of the Orkneys and Gawaines sons will kill your sons and so we shall go on That is the law of the North  But Aglovale I am trying to make a new law in Britain by which people dont have to go on shedding young blood for ever Have you thought that it may be uphill work for me There is a saying that two wrongs dont make a right and I am fond of this saying Dont apply it to yourself   apply it to me I could have punished the Orkneys for murdering your brother I could have cut their heads off Would you have liked me to do that  Yes  Perhaps I ought to have  Arthur looked at his hands as he often did when he was in trouble  Then he said: It is a pity you never had the opportunity of seeing the Orkneys at home They didnt have a happy family life like yours  Aglovale said: Do you think my family life is very happy now Do you know that my mother died a few months ago Father used to call her Piggy  Aglovale I am sorry We had not heard  People used to laugh at my father King I know he was not a formidable character But he must have made a fairly good husband mustnt he for my mother to die of loneliness because he had gone Mother was not an introspective person King but she faded away after the Orkneys had killed father and Lamorak Now she is in the same grave  Yon must do what you think right Aglovale I know you are a true Pellinore and will do that I wont ask any favours for myself But will you let me mention three things The first is that your father was the first knight I ever fell in love with: yet I didnt punish Gawaine The second is that all the Orkneys adored their mother She made them love her too much but she  only loved herself And the third thing  oh Aglovale listen to this one  is that a king can only work with his best tools   Im afraid I dont follow the third point  Do you think asked Arthur that feuds are good things Are they making for happiness in your two families  Not exactly  If I want to stop the feud law do you think it would be any good my appealing to Gawaine and to people like him  I see  What good would it have done if I had executed all the Orkney family We should only have had three knights less to work with And their lives have been unhappy Aglovale So you see my hope is with you  I must think it over  Do Dont decide anything quickly Dont consider me Just do what you think right because you are a Pellinore   and then I know all will turn out for the best Now tell me about your Grail adventures and forget about the Orkneys for one evening  Aglovale heaved a sigh and said: So far as I am concerned there have not been any Grail adventures But it has cost me a sister Perhaps a brother as well  Is your sister dead My poor boy I thought she was safe in a convent  They have found her dead in a sort of boat  Dead in a boat  Yes a magic boat She had a long letter in her hands all about the Grail Quest and about my brother Percy  Are we hurting you by asking questions  No I like to talk about it I still have Dornar left and it seems that Percy has been distinguishing himself  What has Sir Percivale been doing  Perhaps I had better tell you what the letter said from the start  As you know began Sir Aglovale Percy was the one in our family who took after Daddy most He was gentle and humble and a bit vague He was shy too When he met Bors in this magic boat of theirs he was abashed of him it says in the letter He was a maiden knight like Galahad you see I used often to think when I saw them together that he and Daddy made a  good pair They were both fond of animals for one thing and they knew how to get on with them There was Daddys Questing Beast and now Percy seems to have been befriending lions mainly since he went away Also Percy was benevolent and simple One day when they were trying to pull a blessed sword out of a scabbard  I mean the three of them in the holy boat  Percy was given the first pull He did not succeed of course   all that sort of thing was reserved for Galahad  but when he had failed he just looked round proudly and said: By my faith now I have failed However I am getting ahead of rny story  It says in the letter that the first adventure Percy had after leaving Vagon was to ride off with Sir Lancelot until they met Sir Galahad They jousted with him and Galahad gave them both a fall Then Percy left Lancelot and went to a hermitage where he was confessed The hermit advised him to follow Galahad to Goothe or Carbonek and never to fight him As a matter of fact Percy had been seized by a sort of enthusiastic hero worship for Galahad so the advice suited him He rode on to Carbonek where be heard the abbey clock smite as he was pricking through the forest  and it was there that he came across King Evelake who was about four hundred years old I had better leave out about Evelake for I dont quite understand it I think the old man couldnt die until the Holy Grail had been found or something like that But King Pelles is mixed up with it too and all that part of the letter is a bit difficult to follow Anyway Percy had a fight with eight knights and twenty men at arms who set on him at Carbonek and he was rescued in the nick of time by Galahad himself Unfortunately his horse was killed and Galahad rode away again without even passing the time of day  You know said Lionel pausing it may be all very well to be holy and invincible and I dont hold it against Galahad for being a virgin but dont you think that people might be a little human I dont want to be catty but that young man makes my hair go the wrong way Why couldnt he say Good morning or something instead of rescuing a fellow and then riding away in silence with that white nose of his in the air  Arthur made no comment and the young man resumed his story  Percy was trying to join up with Galahad according to instructions and Galahad had ridden off so the poor old fellow just went running after him shouting out I say He had some dreadful troubles trying to borrow horses from people and finally ended up on a grooms hackney cantering after Galahad as fast as it could go But a knight turned up and knocked him off his hackney  Im afraid our family was never exactly in the heroic style  and there he was on foot again with Galahad no nearer Well a lady appeared at this point  they found out afterwards that she was a fairy and not a very nice one at that  and asked him fiercely what he was trying to do Percy said: I do neither good nor great ill what So the lady lent him a black horse which turned out to be a fiend and it vanished in dramatic circumstances when Percy luckily crossed himself that evening He was in a sort of desert by that tune where he proceeded to make friends with a lion by rescuing it from a serpent Percy was always keen on our Dumb Friends as I said  The next thing that happened was that a perfectly delicious gentlewoman turned up with full camping equipment and invited Percy to dinner He was hungry  what with the desert and so forth  and he had never been accustomed to drinking wine so he had a terrific party Im afraid he got a bit huffed and the upshot was that he laughed too much and got excited and asked the lady  well you know The lady was agreeable and it was just going to come off nicely when Percy luckily noticed the cross on the pommel of his sword which was lying on  the ground He blessed himself again and the ladys pavilion turned up so down and off she went in a ship roaring and yelling and the water burned after her  Percy was so ashamed of himself and had such a headache next morning that he stuck his sword into his own thigh as a punishment After that the holy boat turned up with Bors inside it and the two of them sailed away together wherever it would take them  Guenever said: If that holy boat was intended to convey people to the Grail I can perfectly well understand how Bors was in it We know that he had been through some dreadful tests But why Sir Percivale I dont mean to be rude Sir Aglovale but your brother does not seem to have done much  He had preserved his integrity said Arthur He was as clean as Bors  indeed he was cleaner He was perfectly innocent God says something about suffering little children to come unto Him  But such a muddle  Arthur was annoyed  If God is supposed to be merciful he retorted I dont see why He shouldnt allow people to stumble into heaven just as well as climb there Go on with your letter Sir Aglovale  It is at this point that my sister comes into it She was a nun you know and when they first cut off her hair there was a vision to say that it ought to be kept in a box My sister was a learned woman who had a vocation to pursue religious studies Just about the time when Percy and Bors entered the boat a new vision came to the convent which told her to do certain things The first was to look for Sir Galahad  Galahad was spending a night in a hermitage near Carbonek after knocking out Sir Gawaine when my sister found him She made him get up and arm himself and together they rode off to the Collibe Sea where beyond a strong castle they found the blessed barge with Bors and Percy waiting They all sailed away together until they came to a swallow of the sea between two high rocks   and there a second barge was waiting There was some reticence about entering the new boat because it had a scroll on it which warned people off unless they were in perfect faith  but Galahad stepped aboard as usual with his insufferable self confidence They followed him and found a rich bed with a crown of silk on it and a part drawn sword It was King Davids sword There were also three magic spindles made out of the Eden tree and two inferior swords for Percy and Bors Naturally the main sword was for Galahad The pommel was of marvellous stone the scales of the haft were of the ribs of two beasts called Calidone and Ertanax the scabbard was of serpents skin and one side of the sword was as red as blood But the girdle was only plain hemp  My sister set to work with the spindles and made a new girdle out of her own hair which she had brought in the box according to instructions She explained to them about the history of the sword which she knew from her studies and how the spindles had come to be made of wood which was coloured all through the grain and finally the sword was put on Galahad She was a virgin and she fixed it on a virgin with her own hair Then they returned to their first vessel and sailed away toward Carlisle  On the way to Carlisle they rescued an old gentleman who was being kept prisoner by some wicked men in his castle They killed a lot of these men in the fight and Bors and Percy were upset about it but Galahad said it was perfectly all right killing people who had not been christened  and it turned out that these had not been So the old man of the castle asked permission to die in Galahads arms and Galahad condescendingly granted it  When they got to Carlisle there was another castle which belonged to a lady who had the measle The doctors told her that the only cure was to bathe in a dish filled with blood from a clean virgin of royal lineage Everybody who went that way was forced to be bled by the people of the castle and the description fitted my sister The three knights fought all day to save her but in the evening the reason for the custom was explained to them and my siser said: Better is one harm than two She consented to be bled stopped the fighting and the next morning they did it She blessed the surgeons arranged for her body to be floated oft in the holy boat with this letter in her hand and then she died under the operation  Sir Aglovale came back to the King as he was going up to bed after the usual condolences and exclamations had been made The Hall was dark and the jewels of light had gone  By the way he said shyly Will you ask the Orkney faction to have dinner with me tomorrow  Arthur looked at him closely through the looming twilight   then began an enormous smile He kissed Aglovale with a tear which ran into one corner of his smile He said: Now I have got a new Pellinore to love  31 Still there was no news of the great Dulac He had become a magical name which gave warmth to all hearts particularly womens in whatever place he was He had become a maestro himself  was regarded as he had once regarded Uncle Dap If you have learned to fly or been taught by a great musician or fencer you have only to remember that teacher to know how the people of Camelot had come to think of Lancelot They would have died for Mm  for his mastery And he was lost  The survivors trickled in  Palomides now christened and bored to death with the Questing Beast and aged by his long poetic rivalry with Sir Tristram for the love of La Beale Isoud   Sir Grummore Grummursum as bald as an egg now nearly eighty afflicted by gout but still bravely questin  Kay keen eyed and sarcastic  Sir Dinadan making jokes about his own defeats although he was so tired he could barely keep his lids apart  even old Sir Ector of the Forest Sauvage eighty five years old and tottering  They brought with them broken arms and rumours One said that Galahad Bors the other Ector and a nun had been present at a miraculous Mass It had been celebrated by a lamb served by a man & lion an eagle and an ox After the Mass the celebrant had passed out through a stained glass lamb in one of the church windows without breaking the glass thus signifying the immaculate conception Another told how pitilessly Galahad had dealt with a fiend in a tomb how he had cooled the well of lust and how the castle of the leprous lady had finally been tumbled down  These people with their rusty armour and hewn shields had seen Lancelot here and there They spoke of a harnessed ugly man praying at a wayside cross  of a worn face asleep in the moonlight on its shield They spoke also of unbelievable things  of Lancelot unhorsed defeated kneeling after he had been knocked down  Arthur asked questions sent messengers remembered his captain in his prayers Guenever in a dangerous frame of mind began walking on the edge of a verbal precipice At any moment she might say or do something which would be a compromise upon herself and upon her lover Mordred and Agravaine who had been among the first to retire from the Quest watched and waited with bright eyes They were as motionless as Lord Burleigh is said to have been at Queen Elizabeths councils or as a sleek cat who faces the mouse hole secretly  a presence a concentration  The rumours began to be of Lancelots death He had been killed by a black knight at a ford   he had jousted with his own son who had broken his neck  he had gone mad again after being beaten by his son and was riding overthwart and endlong  his armour had been stolen by a mysterious knight and he had been eaten by a beast  he had fought against two hundred and fifty knights been taken captive and hanged like a dog A strong faction believed and hinted that he had been murdered sleeping by the Orkneys and had been buried under a piie of leaves  The faint tail of knighthood straggled in by twos and threes then one at a time then with intervals of days between the solitary riders The list of dead and missing kept by Sir Bedivere began to settle down into a list of dead as the missing either returned exhausted or were confirmed dead by reliable report An obituary tinge began to be present in the whispers about Lancelot He was loved by nearly everybody so that the speakers did not like to do more than whisper of his death for fear that if they spoke of it aloud they would make it true But they whispered about his goodness and remarkable visage: about such and such a blow which he had once given to so and so: about the grace of his leg glides A few obscure pages and kitchenmaids who remembered vividly a smile or a tip at Christmas went to sleep with damp pillows although they knew that the great captain could not have been expected even to remember their names Kay startled everybody by declaring with a sniff that he himself had always been a mean blackguard and then went quickly out of the room blowing his nose In all the court a tension grew and a feeling of doom  Lancelot came back out of a rainstorm wet and small He was leading an old barrel of a white mare without a trot left in her The black autumn clouds were behind them and her hollow ribs stood out like flake white against their indigo A magic a mind reading an intuition must have taken place  for all the palace battlements and turrets and the drawbridge of the Great Gate were thronged with people waiting and watching and pointing in silence before ever he appeared When the tiny figure could be seen threading wearily through the far trees of the chase a murmuration went up among the people It was Lancelot in a scarlet gown beside the white He was safe Everything was known about all his adventures before anything had been spoken Arthur ran about like a madman telling everybody to go in to leave the battlements to give the man a chance By the time the figure arrived there was nobody to hurt him Only the Great Gate stood open and Uncle Dap was there bent and wMte headed to receive his horse  Hundreds of eyes glancing from behind curtains saw the spent man hand the reins to his squire  saw him standing with bowed head which he had never raised  saw him turn and pace toward his own apartment and vanish in the darkness of the turret stair  Two hours later Uncle Dap presented himself in the Kings chamber He had been undressing Lancelot and putting him to bed Under the scarlet gown he said there had been a fair white garment  under that a horrible shirt of hair Sir Lancelot had sent him with a message He was very tired and begged the Kings pardon He would wait on him tomorrow Meanwhile so that there should be no delay about the important news Uncle Dap was to tell the King that the Holy Grail had been found Galahad Percivale and Bors had found it and with it and with the body of Percivales sister they had arrived at Sarras in Babylon The Grail could not be brought to Camelot Bors would be coming home eventually but the others were never to return  32 Guenever had overdressed for the occasion She had put on a make up which she did not need and put it on badly She was forty two  When Lancelot saw her waiting for him at the table with Arthur beside her the heart sack broke in his wame and the love inside it ran about his veins It was his old love for a girl of twenty standing proudly by her throne with the present of captives about her  but now the same girl was standing in other surroundings the surroundings of bad make up and loud silks by which she was trying to defy the invincible doom of human destiny He saw her as the passionate spirit of innocent youth now beleaguered by the trick which is played on youth  the trick of treachery in the body which turns flesh into green bones Her stupid finery was not vulgar to him but touching The girl was still there still appealing from behind the breaking barricade of rouge She had made the brave protest: I will not be vanquished Under the clumsy coquetry the undignified clothes there was the human cry for help The young eyes were puzzled saying: It is I inside here  what have they done to me I will not submit Some part of her spirit knew that the powder was making a guy of her and hated it and tried to hold her lover with the eyes alone They said: Dont look at all this Look at me I am still here in the eyes Look at me here in the prison and help me out Another part said: I am not old it is illusion I am beautifully made up See I will perform the movements of youth I will defy the enormous army of age  Lancelot saw one soul alone a condemned and innocent child holding her indefensible position with the contemptible arms of hair dye and orange silk with which she had  with what fears  hoped to please him He saw  The impassioned pigmy fist Clenched cloudward and defiant The pride that would prevail the doomed protagonist Grappling the ghostly giant  Arthur said: Are you rested now How are you feeling  We are so glad to see you said Guenever so glad to have you back  They on their side saw a man of serenity  the kind of sage that Kipling described in Kim They saw their new Lancelot as a silence and perception He had come from the height of his spirit  Lancelot said: Im quite rested now thank you I expect you want to know about the Grail  The King said: It has been selfish of me Im afraid I have kept everybody out We will have it written down and put in almeries at Salisbury But we did want to hear it from you first Lance without interruptions  Are you sure you wont be too tired to tell  Lancelot smiled and took their hands  There isnt much to tell he said After all I didnt find the Grail myself  Sit down and break your fast You can talk when you have eaten You are much thinner  Would you like a glass of hippocras or some perry  I am not drinking at present he said thank you  While he was eating the King and Queen sat on either side and watched Before he knew that he wanted the salt   just as his fingers were beginning to reach for it  they handed it to him He laughed at their serious faces which made him feel uncomfortable and pretended to asperge Arthur with his cup of water to make them smile  Do you want a relic he asked You could have my boots if you like They are quite worn out  Lancelot it is not a thing to joke about I believe you have seen the Holy Grail yourself  Even if I have seen it I dont need to be handed the salt  But they still looked at him  Lancelot said: Please understand It is Galahad and the others who were allowed the Grail I was not allowed it So it will be wrong and you will hurt me if you make a fuss about it How many of the knights got back  Half said Arthur We have heard their stories  I expect you know more about it than I do  We only know that the homicides and those who didnt confess were turned back; and you say that Galahad Bors and Percivale were allowed I am told that Galahad and Percivale were virgins; and Bors although he was not quite a virgin turned out to be a first class theologian I suppose Bors passed for his dogma and Percivale for his innocence I know hardly anything about Galahad except that everybody dislikes him  Dislikes him  They complain about his being inhuman  Lancelot considered his cup  He is inhuman he said at last But why should he be human Are angels supposed to be human  I dont quite follow  Do you think that if the Archangel Michael were to come here this minute he would say: What charming weather we are having today Wont you have a glass of whisky  I suppose not  Arthur you mustnt feel that I am rude when I say this You must remember that I have been away in strange and desert places sometimes quite alone sometimes in a boat with nobody but God and the whistling sea Do you know since I have been back with people I have felt I was going mad Not from the sea but from the people All my gains are slipping away with the people round me A lot of the things which you and Jenny say even seem to me to be needless: strange noises: empty You know what I mean How are you  Do sit down   What nice weather we are having What does it matter People talk far too much Where I have been and where Galahad is it is a waste of time to have manners Manners are only needed between people to keep their empty affairs in working order Manners makyth man you know not God So you can understand how Gaiahad may have seemed inhuman and mannerless and so on to the people who were buzzing and clacking about him He was far away in his spirit living on desert islands in silence with eternity  I see  Please dont think me rude to say these things I am trying to explain a feeling If you had ever been to Patricks Purgatory you would know what I mean People seem ridiculous when you come out  I see exactly I understand about Galahad too  He was a lovely person really I spent a long time in a boat with him and I know But this did not mean that we always had to be offering each other the best seat in the boat  It was my worldly knights who disliked him most I see However we are waiting to hear your story Lance not Galahads  Yes Lance; tell us how you got on and leave out about the angels  As I was never allowed to meet any angels said Sir Lancelot with a smile its the best thing I can do  Go on  When I left Vagon began the commander in chief I had a shrewd idea that the best place to search would be the castle of King Pelles    He stopped for Guenever had made a sudden move  I didnt go to the castle he said gently because I had an accident Something happened to me which was outside my own plans and after that I went where I was taken  What was the accident  It was not an accident really It was the first stroke of a correction which I have had and for which I am thankful Do you know I shall be talking about God a great deal and this is a word which offends unholy people just as badly as words like damn and so on offend the holy ones What shall we have to do about it  Just assume that we are the holy ones said the King and go on about your accident  I was riding with Sir Percivale when we came across my son He unhorsed me at the first tilt  my son did  A surprise attack said Arthur quickly  It was a fair tilt  Naturally you would not want to beat your son  I did want to beat him  Guenever said: Everybody has to be unlucky sometimes  I rode at Galahad with all the skill I could manage and he gave me the finest fall I ever had  Indeed added Lancelot with one of his gaping grins I might say that he gave me one of the only falls I ever had The first thing I can remember feeling when I was lying on the ground was pure astonishment It was only later that it turned to something else  What did you do  I was lying on the ground and Galahad was standing his horse beside me without saying a word when a woman came up who was a recluse in a hermitage where we had been fighting She made a curtsy and said: God be with thee best knight of the world  Lancelot looked on the table and moved his hand in a gesture to stroke the cloth Then he cleared his throat and said: I looked up to see who was talking to me  The King and Queen waited  Lancelot cleared his throat again: I am trying to tell you about my spirit if you see what I mean not about my adventures So I cant be modest about it I am a bad man I know but I  was always good with arms It was a consolation to me in my badness sometimes to think   to know that I was the best knight of the world  And so   Well the lady was not talking to me  They digested the position in silence watching a flutter which had developed on the right side of his mouth  Galahad  Yes said Sir Lancelot The lady was looking past me at my son Galahad and he cantered away as soon as she had spoken Soon afterwards the lady went away as well  What a disgusting thing to say exclaimed the King What a dirty deliberate outrage She ought to have been whipped  It was true  But to come and say it in front of you on purpose cried Guenever Besides after a single fall    She said what God told her to say You see she was a holy woman But I couldnt understand it at the time    I am much holier now he added apologetically but at the time I couldnt bear it I felt as if my prop had been taken from me and I knew that she only said the simple truth I felt as if she had broken the last piece of my heart So I rode away from Percivale to be by myself like an animal with my hurt Percivale suggested something to do but I only said: Do as ye list I rode away with heavy cheer overthwart and endlong to find a place where I could split my heart alone I rode to a chapel eventually feeling as if I might be going mad again You see Arthur I had a lot of troubles on my mind which being a famous fighter seemed to make up for a little and when that was gone it felt as if there was nothing left to me  There was everything left You are still the finest fighter in the world  The funny thing was that the chapel had no door I dont know whether it was my sins or my resentment at being broken but I couldnt get in I slept on my shield outside and there was a dream of a knight who came and took away my helm and my sword and my horse I tried to wake up but I couldnt All my knightly things were being taken away from me but I could not wake because my heart was full of bitter thoughts A voice said that I was never more to have worship  but I only rebelled against the voice and so when I woke the things were gone  Arthur if I dont make you understand about that night you will never understand the rest I had spent all my childhood when I might have been chasing butterflies learning to be your best knight Afterwards I was wicked but I had one thing I used to feel so proud inside myself because I knew that I was supposed to be top of the averages It was a base feeling I know But I had nothing else to be proud of First my Word and my miracles had gone and  now on the night I am telling you about this was gone too When I woke up and found that my arms were taken I walked about in agony It was disgusting but I cried ana cursed That was the time when they began to break me  My poor Lance  It was the best thing that ever happened In the morning do you know I heard the little fowls singing  and that cheered me up Funny to be comforted by a lot of birds I never had time for birds nesting when I was small You would have known what kind of birds they were Arthur   but I couldnt tell There was one very small one which cocked its tail in the air and looked at me It was about as big as the rowel of a spur  Perhaps it was a wren  Well then it was a wren Will you show me one tomorrow The thing which these birds made me see because my black heart could not see it alone was that if I was to be punished it was because of my own nature What happened to the birds was according to the nature of birds They made me see that the world was beautiful if you were beautiful and that you couldnt get unless you gave And you had to give without wanting to get So I accepted that beating from Galahad and the taking away of my armour; and in a blessed moment I went to find a confessor so that I would not be wicked any more  All the knights said Arthur who got to the Grail had the sense to be confessed first  I had always made bad confessions before that I have lived nearly all my life in mortal sin But this time I confessed everything  Everything asked the Queen  Everything You see Arthur I have had a sin on my conscience all my life which I thought I could not tell to people because    There is no need to tell it to us said the Queen if it hurts you After all we are not your confessors It was enough to tell the priest  Leave her in peace agreed the King At any rate she bore a fine son who seems to have achieved the Grail  He was alluding to Elaine  Lancelot looked with sudden misery from one to the other and clenched his fists All three stopped breathing  I confessed then he said eventually and they breathed again  but his voice was leaden I was given a penance He paused still doubtful half recognizing the moment as a cross road of his life Now was the time they all knew if there ever was to be a time when he ought to have it out with his friend and king  yet Guenever was thwarting him It was her secret too  The penance was to wear the hair shirt of a certain dead religious that we knew of he went on at last defeated I was to take no meat or wine and to hear Mass daily So I left the  priests house after three days and rode back to a cross near the place where I had lost my arms The priest had loaned me some to go on with Well I slept at the cross that night and had another dream  and in the morning the knight who had stolen my armour came back I jousted with him and retrieved the armour Wasnt that strange  I suppose you were in a state of grace now after your good confession so you could be trusted with your might  That was what I thought but you will see about it presently I thought now that I had got my sin off my chest I would be allowed to be the best knight in the world once more I rode away very happy trying to sing a bit until I came to a fair plain with a castle and pavilions and everything  and there was a tournament of five hundred knights in black and white The white knights were winning so I thought I would join with the black I thought I would do a great exploit of rescue for the weaker party now that I was forgiven He stopped and closed his eyes But the white knights he added opening them took me prisoner quite soon  You mean you were beaten again  I was beaten and disgraced I thought I was more sinful than ever When they had set me loose I rode and cursed just as I had done on the first evening and when the night came I lay down under an apple tree and actually cried myself to sleep  But this is heresy exclaimed the Queen who was a good theologian like most women If you were clean confessed and had done penance and been absolved    I had done penance for one sin said Lancelot But I had forgotten about another one In the night I had a new dream of an old man who came to me and said: Ah Lancelot of evil faith and poor belief why is thy will turned so lightly toward thy deadly sin Jenny I have all my life been in another sin the worst of all It was pride that made me try to be the best knight in the world Pride made me show off and help the weaker party of the tournament You could call it vainglory Just because I had confessed about   about the woman that did not make me into a good man  So you were beaten  Yes I was beaten And next morning I went to another hermit to be confessed again This time I made a thorough job of it I was told that it was not enough in the Quest for the Grail to be continent and to refrain from killing people All boasting and pride of the world had to be left behind for God did not like such deeds in his Quest I had to renounce all earthly glory And I did renounce it and was absolved  What happened next  I rode to the water of Mortoise where a black knight came to joust with me He knocked me down as well  A third defeat  Guenever cried: But if you really were absolved this time  Lancelot put his hand over hers and smiled  If a boy steals sweets he said and his parents punish him he may be very sorry and good afterwards But that doesnt entitle him to steal more sweets does it Nor does it mean that he must be given sweets God was not punishing me by letting the black knight knock me down  he was only withholding the special gift of victory which it had always been within his power to bestow  But my poor Lance to have given up your glory and not to get anything back When you were a sinful man you were always victorious so why should you always be beaten when you were heavenly And why are you always hurt by the things you love What did you do  I knelt down in the water of Mortoise Jenny where he had knocked me  and I thanked God for the adventure  33 Arthur could not stand much more of this  It is disgusting he exclaimed indignantly I dont like to listen to it Why should a good kind dear person be tortured like that It makes me feel ashamed inside even to hear of it What    Hush said Sir Lancelot 1 am very glad that I gave up love and glory And what is more I was practically forced to do it God did not take such pains for Gawaine or Lionel did he  Bah said King Arthur in the tone which Gawaine had used before him  Lancelot laughed  Well he said thats a convincing remark But perhaps you had better hear the end of the story  I lay down by the water of Mortoise that evening and a dream came which told me to go in a ship The ship was there when I woke up sure enough; and when I went inside it there was the most lovely smell and feeling and food to eat and  well whatever you can think of I was fulfilled with all things that I thought on or desired I know I cant explain to you about the ship at this hour because for one thing it is fading from me now that I am with people But you mustnt think just of incense in the ship or precious cloths on it There were these but they were not the loveliness You must think of a tar smell too and the colours of the sea Sometimes it was quite green like thick glass and you could see the bottom Sometimes it was all in big slow terraces and the water fowl who were flying along the top vanished in the hollows When it was stormy the huge fangs of the breakers gnawed at the rocky islands They made white fangs on the cliffs not as they burst up but as the water streamed down At night when it was calm you could see the stars reflected on the wet sands There were two stars quite close together The sands were all ribbed like the roof of your mouth And there was the smell of seaweed the noise of the lonely wind There were islands with little birds on them like rabbits but their noses were rainbows The whiter was the best thing because then  there were the geese on the islands  long smoke lines of them singing like hounds in the cold streak of morning  It is no good being indignant about what God did to me at the beginning Arthur for he gave me far more in return I said: Fair Sweet Father Jesu Christ I wot not in what joy I am for this joy passeth all earthly joys that ever I was in  A strange feature about the ship was that there was a dead woman in it She had a letter in her hand which told me how the others had been getting on It was stranger still that I was not frightened of her for being dead She had such a calm face that she was company for me We felt a sort of communion together in the ship and in the sea I dont know what I was fed on  When I had been in this ship with the dead lady for a month Galahad was brought to us He gave me his blessing and let me kiss his sword  Arthur was as red as a turkey cock  Did you ask for his blessing he demanded  Of course  Well said Arthur  We sailed in the holy ship for six months together I got to know my son very well in that time and he seemed to care for me Quite often he said the most courteous things We had adventures with animals on the out islands all that time There were sea weasels which whistled beautifully and Galahad showed me cranes flying along the water with their shadows flying under them upside down He told me that the fishing people call a cormorant the Old Black Hag and that ravens live as long as men They went cronk cronk high in the air and came tumbling down for fun One day we saw a pair of choughs: they were beautiful And the seals They came along beside the music of the ship and talked like men  One Monday we came to a forest land A white knight rode down on the shore and told Galahad to come out of the boat I knew that he was being taken away to find the Holy Grail so I was sad that I couldnt go too Do you remember when you were little how children used to pick up sides for a game and perhaps you wouldnt be picked at all It felt like that but worse I asked Galahad to pray for me I asked him to pray God to hold me in his service Then we kissed each other and said good bye  Guenever complained: If you were in a state of grace I cant understand why you should have been left  It is difficult said Lancelot  He opened his hands and looked between them on the table  Perhaps my intentions were bad he said at length Perhaps inside myself unconsciously you could say I had not a proper purpose of amendment  The Queen was subtly radiant as she listened  Nonsense she whispered meaning the opposite She pressed his band warmly and Lancelot took it away  When I prayed to be held he said perhaps it was because  It seems to me said Arthur that you are allowing yourself the luxury of a needlessly tender conscience  Perhaps At all events I was not picked  He sat watching the sea heaving between his hands and hearing the wooden clatter of gannets on an island cliff  The ship took me out to sea again he said at length on a big wind I did not sleep very much and I prayed a great deal I asked that in spite of not being picked I might be allowed to get some tidings of the Sangreal  In the silence which fell on the room they pursued their separate thoughts Arthurs were of the pitiful spectacle   the show of an earthly sinful man but the best of them plodding along behind these three supernatural virgins; his doomed courageous vain toil  Funny said Lancelot how the people who cant pray say that prayers are not answered however much the people who can pray say they are My ship took me at midnight in a great gale to the back side of Carbonek Castle Strange also that it should have been the very place I was heading for when I started  The moment the ship came alongside I knew that I was to be granted a part of my desire I couldnt see it all of course because I was not a Galahad or Bors But they were very kind to me They went out of their way to be kind  It was black as death behind the castle I put on my armour and went up There were two lions at the entry of the stairs who tried to bar my way I drew my sword to fight them but a hand struck me on the arm It was silly of me of course to trust in my sword when I could have trusted in God So I blessed myself with my numb arm and went in and the lions didnt hurt me All the doors were open except the last one and there I kneeled down When I prayed it opened  Arthur this must seem untrue as I tell it I dont know a way of putting it in words Behind the last door there was a chapel They were at Mass  Oh Jenny the beautiful chapel with all its lights and everything You would say: The flowers and the candles But it was not these Perhaps there were none  It was oh the shout of it  the power and the glory It seized on all my senses to drag me in  But I couldnt go in Arthur and Jenny  there was a sword to stop me Galahad was inside and Bors and Percivale There were nine other knights from France and Danemark and Ireland: and the lady from my ship was there as well The Grail was there Arthur on a silver table and other things But I was forbidden to go in for all my yearning at the door I dont know who the priest was It may have been Joseph of Arimathea it may have been   oh  well I did go in to help him  in spite of the sword   because he was carrying what was too heavy to be carried I only wanted to help Arthur as God was my witness But a breath smote my face at the last door like a blast from a furnace and there I fell down dumb  In the dark chamber there was a coming and going of maids The cans and pails rattled on the stairway and there was much steam When the maids trod in the puddles on the floor they made a slashing noise and from the next room there was whispering mixed with the secret noise of silk  The Queen had climbed the six steps of the wooden ladder which led to her bath and now she was sitting on the plank inside it with her head showing over the top The bath was like a large beer barrel and her head was wrapped in a white turban She was naked except for a pearl necklace There was a mirror  it had been very expensive  in one corner and a little table in another one held the scents and oils Instead of a powder puff there was a chamois leather bag with powdered chalk in it scented with attar of roses from the crusades All over the floor between the puddles there was a confusion of linen towels for drying her and of jewellery boxes brocades garments garters shifts which had been brought from the other room for her to choose There were some condemned head dresses lying in disgrace  strange shapes of starch like candle extinguishers and meringues and the double horns of cows The hair nets which kept them together were strung with pearls and the kerchiefs were of Eastern silk One of the ladies in waiting was standing in front of the Queens tub holding an embroidered mantle for inspection It was charged with the impaled arms of her husband and of her father: the dragon rampant of England and the six charming lioncels passant regardant of King Leodegrance who bore lions on account of his name This mantle had a heavy silk tassel like a curtain cord to join it across her breast The silk bordure was furred with countervail silver and blue  Guenever had lost her raddled look and sat accepting the clothes which were recommended for her without fuss The ladies in waiting had a happy air For more than a year they had waited on a Queen who was petulant cruel contradictory miserable Now she was pleased with anything and did not hurt them They were all quite sure that Lancelot must have become her lover again This was not the case  Guenever looked upon the six lioncels passant regardant   they were marching along with red tongues and claws winking pertly over their backsides and waving their flame tipped tails She nodded her head with a contented sleepy look and the lady in waiting carried it to the dressing room with a curtsy The Queen watched her go  You could pretend that Guenever was a sort of man eating lioncelle herself or that she was one of those selfish women who insist on ruling everywhere In fact this is what she did seem to be to a superficial inspection She was beautiful sanguine hot tempered demanding impulsive acquisitive charming  she had all the proper qualities for a man  eater But the rock on which these easy explanations founder is that she was not promiscuous There was never anybody in her life except Lancelot and Arthur She never ate anybody except these And even these she did not eat in the full sense of the word People who have been digested by a man eating lioncelle tend to become nonentities  to live no life except within the vitals of the devourer Yet both Arthur and Lancelot the people whom she apparently devoured lived full lives and accomplished things of their own  One explanation of Guenever for what it is worth is that she was what they used to call a real person She was not the kind who can be fitted away safely under some label or other as loyal or disloyal or self sacrificing or jealous Sometimes she was loyal and sometimes she was disloyal She behaved like herself And there must have been something in this self some sincerity of heart or she would not have held two people like Arthur and Lancelot Like likes like they say  and at least they are certain that her men were generous She must have been generous too It is difficult to write about a real person  She lived in warlike times when the lives of young people were as short as those of airmen in the twentieth century In such times the elderly moralists are content to relax their moral laws a little in return for being defended The condemned pilots with their lust for the life and love which is probably to be lost so soon touch the hearts of young women or possibly call up an answering bravado Generosity courage honesty pity the faculty to look short life in the face  certainly comradeship and tenderness   these qualities may explain why Guenever took Lancelot as well as Arthur It was courage more than anything else   the courage to take and give from the heart while there was time Poets are always urging women to have this kind of courage She gathered her rose buds while she might and the striking thing was that she only gathered two of them which she kept always and that those two were the best  Guenevers central tragedy was that she was childless Arthur had two illegitimate children and Lancelot had Galahad But Guenever  and she was the one of the three who most ought to have had children and who would have been best with children and whom God had seemingly made for breeding lovely children  she was the one who was left an empty vessel a shore without a sea This was what broke her when she came to the age at which her sea must finally dry It is what turned her for a little time into a raving woman though that time was still in the future It may be one of the explanations of her double love  perhaps she loved Arthur as a father and Lancelot because of the son she could not have  People are easily dazzled by Round Tables and feats of arms You read of Lancelot in some noble achievement and when he comes home to his mistress you feel resentment at her because she cuts across the achievement or spoils it Yet Guenever could not search for the Grail She could oot vanish into the English forest for a years adventure with the spear It was her part to sit at home though passionate though real and hungry in her fierce and tender heart For her there were no recognized diversions except what is comparable to the ladies bridge party of today She could hawk with a merlin or play blind mans buff or pince  merille These were the amusements of grown up women in her time But the great hawks the hounds heraldry tournaments  these were for Lancelot For her unless she felt like a little spinning or embroidery there was no occupation  except Lancelot  So we must imagine the Queen as a woman who had been robbed of her central attribute As she grew to her difficult age she did strange things She was even to be suspected of poisoning a knight She even became unpopular But unpopularity is often a compliment   and Guenever though she lived tempestuously and finally died in an unreconciled sort of way  she was not cut out for religion as Lancelot was  was never insignificant She did what women do on the whole right royally and at the moment in the tub with the lioncels before her she was busy doing it  When a man had practically seen God however human he might be you could not immediately expect him as a lover When the man was Lancelot who was mad on God in any  case you had to be both sanguine and cruel to expect him like that at all But women are cruel in this way They do not accept excuses  Guenever knew that Lancelot would come back to her She had known it from the moment when he had prayed to be held The knowledge had revived her like a watered flower too long left unwatered It had swept away the rouge and bedizening silks which had moved his pity when he first came back Now it only remained for her to accomplish the reunion smoothly and fully There was no hurry  Lancelot who did not know that he was to betray his much loved God again for the sake of the Queen was made happy by her attitude  though it surprised him He had feared some terrible scene of jealousy or recrimination He had wondered how he would be able to explain to the tortured child imprisoned in the painted eyes that he could not come to her  that he had a sweeter necessity however much her pain He had been afraid that she would attack him would lay her poor snares before him  snares which would be all the more pitifully beguiling because of their poverty He had really not known how he was to face the pity  Instead Guenever had bloomed and lost her paints She had made no assault no recrimination She had smiled with real joy Women he had told himself wisely were unpredictable He had even been able to discuss the matter with her in complete frankness and she had agreed with what he said  Guenever sitting in the bath and looking sightlessly upon the lioncels had a sleepy look of secret happiness when she remembered their conversation She saw the charming ugly face talking so seriously about the interests of its honest heart She loved these interests  loved the old soldier to follow so faithfully his innocent love of God She knew it was doomed to failure  Lancelot had said apologizing and begging her not to think him offensive (1) that they could not very well go back to the old way after the Grail; (2) that had it not been for their guilty love he might have been allowed to achieve the Grail; (3) that it would be dangerous in any case because the Orkney faction was beginning to watch them unpleasantly particularly Agravaine and Mordred; and (4) that it would be a great shame to thelmselves and also to Arthur He numbered the points carefully  At other times he tried to explain to her in confused words and at great length about his discovery of God He thought that if he could convert Guenever to God this would solve the moral problem If they could go to God together he would not be deserting his mistress or sacrificing her happiness to his own  The Queen smiled outright He was a darling She had agreed with every word he said  was a regular convert already  Then she lifted one white arm out of the bath and reached for a scrubbing brush on an ivory handle  35  It was all very well at the first flush of his return Queens may see further ahead than common men but there seems to be a limit to their vision It was fine to wait with a warm feeling while Lancelot kept faith with his divinity for a week or for a month But when the months began to grow to a year then it was a different matter Perhaps he would relapse in the end  perhaps But a woman could wait too long for victory  she could be too old to enjoy it It could be senseless to go on waiting for a joy when joy was on the doorstep and Time hurried by  Guenever grew slowly not less blooming but angrier A storm gathered in her deep breasts as the months of holiness added together Holiness Selfishness she cried to herself   selfish to abandon another soul so as to save your own The story of Bors allowing the twelve supposed gentlewomen to be hurled from the castle turret rather than save them by committing a mortal sin had shocked her to the heart Now Lancelot was doing the same thing It was well for him with his chivalry and mysticism and all the compensations of the male world to make the grand renunciation But it took two to make a renunciation just as it took two to make love or to make a quarrel She was not an insensate piece of property to be taken up or laid down at his convenience You could not give up a human heart as you could give up drinking The drink was yours and you could give it up: but your lovers soul was not your own: it was not at your disposal; you had a duty towards it  Lancelot saw these things as clearly as the bold Guenever   and as their relations gradually worsened he was hard put to it to keep his mind It was for him the same as it had been for Bors when the unarmed hermit interfered So far as he himself was concerned he had every right to insist on yielding to the God he loved as Bors had yielded to Lionel  But when Guenever threw herself across him as the hermit had thrown himself across Bors had he the right to sacrifice his old love as the hermit had been sacrificed Lancelot like the Queen was shocked by the solutions of Bors The hearts of these two lovers were instinctively too generous to fit with dogma Generosity is the eighth deadly sin  It came to a head one morning while they were singing together alone in the solar A musical instrument called a regal stood on the table between them It looked like two large bibles Guenever had sung a little piece by French Mary and Lancelot was plodding his way through another by the hunchback of Arras when the Queen put her right hand on all the notes which she could cover and pressed both bibles with her left The regal gave a dreadful sneer and died  Why did you do that  You had better go she said Go away Start a quest Cant you see that you are wearing me out  Lancelot took a deep breath and said: Yes I do see it every day  Then you had better go No I am not making a scene I dont want to quarrel about it and I dont want to alter your mind But I think it would be kinder if you went  It sounds as if I were hurting you on purpose  No It is not your fault But I would just like you to go Lance so as to give me a rest For a little while We neednt fight about it  If you want me to go I will of course  I do want you to  Perhaps it would be better  Lance I want you to realize that I am not trying to trick you into anything or to force you It is only that I think it would be good for us to be parted for a month or two as friends It is only that  I know you would never try to trick me Jenny And I feel muddled too I was hoping that you would understand about it About what has happened to me It would have been easy if you had been on that boat as well or felt it yourself But I cant make you feel it because you were not there and so it is difficult for me I feel as if I were sacrificing you or us if you like to a new sort of love   And besides he said turning away it is not as if  as if I didnt want my old love too  After he had stood in silence for a minute looking out of the window with his hands unnaturally still at his sides be added in a harsh voice without turning round: If you like we will start again  When he swung round from the window the room was empty After dinner he asked for the Queen at her door but received only a verbal message begging him to do as she had asked He packed his scanty traps not understanding what had happened but feeling that he had escaped calamity by a hairbreadth He said good bye to his bent old squire who was now far too ancient to go with him in any case and rode from Camelot next morning  36 If the maids in waiting were pleased by the Queens supposed renewal of intrigue there were others at court who were not or if they were pleased it was a cruel and waiting pleasure The tone of the court had changed for the fourth time  There had been the first feeling a companionship of youth under which Arthur had launched his grand crusade  the second of chivalrous rivalry growing staler every year in the greatest court of Europe until it had nearly turned to feud and empty competition Then the enthusiasm of the Grail had burned the bad gasses of the air into a short lived beauty Now the maturest or the saddest phase had come in which enthusiasm had been used up for good and only our famous seventh sense was left to be practised The court had knowledge of the world now: it had the fruits of achievement civilization savoir vivre gossip fashion malice and the broad mind of scandal  Half the knights had been killed  the best half What Arthur had feared from the start of the Grail Quest had come to pass If you achieve perfection you die There had been nothing left for Galahad to ask of God except death The best knights had gone to perfection leaving the  worst to hold their sieges A leaven of love was left it is true   Lancelot Gareth Aglovale and a few old dodderers like Sir Grummore and Sir Palomides: but the tone was set elsewhere It came from the surly angers of Gawaine the fripperies of Mordred and the sarcasms of Agravaine Tristram had done no good to it in Cornwall A magic cloak had gone the rounds which only a faithful wife could wear  or perhaps it was a magic horn which only a faithful wife could drink from A canting shield had been presented with a voiceless snigger a shield whose blazon was a hint to cuckolds Marital fidelity had become news Clothes had become fantastic The long toes of Agravaines slippers were secured by gold chains to garters below his knee and as for Mordreds toes their chains were secured to a belt round his waist The surcoats which had originally served as covering to armour were long behind and high in front You could hardly walk for fear of tripping over your sleeves Ladies were compelled to shave their foreheads and to show no hair if they wanted to be in the mode while so far as their sleeves were concerned they had to tie knots in them to keep them off the floor Gentlemen showed their legs to an equally startling extent Their clothes were parti coloured Sometimes one leg was red and the other was green And they did not wear their slittered mantle their gaycoat graceless from a sense of exuberance Mordred wore his ridiculous shoes contemptuously: they were a satire on himself The court was modern  So there were eyes on Guenever now  not the eyes of strong suspicion or of warm connivance but the bored looks of calculation and the cold ones of society At the mouse  hole the sleek cats were still  Mordred and Agravaine thought Arthur hypocritical  as all decent men must be if you assume that decency cant exist They found Guenever barbarous  La Beale Isoud they said had made a cuckold of King Mark in a civilized way She had done it with an air publicly fashionably in the best taste Everybody had been able to rub it into the King and to enjoy the fun She had shown a perfect flair for dress for comic hats which made her look like a tipsy heifer She had spent millions of Marks money on peacock tongues for dinner  Guenever on the other hand dressed like a gipsy entertained like a lodging house keeper and kept her lover a secret On top of this she was a nuisance She had no sense of style She was growing old ungracefully and she cried or made scenes like a fishwife It was said that she had sent Lancelot away after a terrible quarrel during which she had accused him of loving other women She was supposed to have cried out: I see and feel daily that thy love beginneth to slake Mordred said in his equivocal musical voice that he could understand a fishwife but not a fish mistress The epigram was widely reported  Arthur reserved and unhappy in the new atmosphere which had begun to pull away from him instead of with him moved about the palace in his plain dress trying to be polite The Queen more aggressive  she had been a bold girl as he first remembered her with dark hair and red lips tossing her head  went out to meet the situation and tried to deal with it by entertaining and by pretending to be fashionable herself She fell back on the paints and finery which she had left when Lancelot returned She began to behave as if she were a little mad All glorious reigns have these blank patches during which the Crown is unpopular  Trouble came suddenly while Lancelot was away The feeling of danger which had hung in the air since the Grail suddenly crystallized upon a dinner party given by the Queen  It seems that Gawaine was fond of fruit He liked apples and pears best  and the poor Queen anxious to be successful in her new line as a fashionable entertainer took particular care to have nice apples when she gave a dinner for twenty four knights at which Gawaine was to be present She knew that the Cornwall and Orkney faction had always been the menace to her husbands hopes  and Gawaine was now the head of the clan She hoped that the dinner would be a success that it would help in the new atmosphere that it would be a sophisticated dinner She was trying to placate her critics by being a courteous hostess like La Beale Isoud  Unfortunately there were other people who knew of Gawaines weakness for apples and bad blood over the Pellinore murders still existed Arthur had managed to wean Sir Aglovale from his revenge it is true and the old feud seemed to have healed over But there was a knight called Sir Pinel who was a distant relative of the Pellinores and he considered that revenge was necessary Sir Pinel poisoned the apples  Poison is a bad weapon It went astray in this case as it often does and an Irish knight called Patrick ate the apple which was intended for Gawaine  You can imagine the situation: the pale knights starting to their feet in the candlelight the ineffectual attempts at aid and their supposing eyes turning upon one another with ashamed suspicion Everybody knew of Gawaines foible His family had never been favourites with the now unpopular Queen She herself had given the dinner And Pinel was not in a position to explain Somebody in that room had murdered Sir Patrick in mistake for Gawaine and until the murderer was discovered they would all be under the same suspicion Sir Mador de la Porte  more pompous than the rest or more malevolent or more of a stickler  ended by voicing the thought which was in every mind He accused the Queen of treason  Nowadays when a point of justice is obscure and difficult each side hires lawyers to argue it out In those days the upper classes hired champions to fight it out  which came to the same thing Sir Mador decided to save himself the expense of a champion by fighting his own case and he insisted that Guenever must brief a champion for her defence Arthur whose whole philosophy of royalty hinged on justice instead of power could do nothing to save his wife If Mador demanded the Court of Honour he must have it And Arthur could not fight in his wifes quarrel just as married people are not allowed to give evidence against each other today  Here was a pretty state of affairs Suspicion and rumour and counter recrimination had obscured the issue almost before it started The Peilinore feud the old Pendragon Cornwall feud the Lancelot entanglement and then the sudden death of a person not apparently concerned with any of them  all these mixed thelmselves together into a fume of venom which coiled about the Queen If Lancelot had been there he would have fought as her champion But she had sent him away  nobody knew where some thought to his parents in France Perhaps if he had been known to be on hand Sir Mador might have swallowed his accusation  It seems kinder not to dwell on the days before the trial by battle  not to describe the distracted woman kneeling to Sir Bors who had never liked her before and who now just back from his virginal achievement of the Grail liked her still less She begged him to fight for her if Lancelot could not be found She had to beg for it poor creature because the feeling at court had come to such a pitch that nobody would accept her brief The Queen of England was unable to command a champion  The night before the battle was the worst All night neither she nor Arthur slept He firmly believed her innocence but he could not interfere with justice She pathetically and repeatedly asserting this innocence although she was in the entanglement which the other trouble had brought her to knew that the next night might see her burned to death Together they saw the tragedy and humiliation of their Table from which no man was willing to save them   knew that the Queen of it was called by common breath a destroyer of good knights In the bitter darkness Arthur suddenly cried despairingly: What aileth you that ye cannot keep Sir Lancelot on your side And so it went on until the morning  37 Sir Bors the misogynist had reluctantly consented to fight for the Queen if nobody else could be found He had explained that it was irregular to do so because he himself had been present at the dinner  but when discovered by Arthur with the Queen kneeling at his feet he had blushed raised her and consented Then he had vanished for a day or two because the trial was not to take place for a fortnight  A meadow at Westminster had been prepared for the combat A barricade of strong logs like a corral for horses had been erected round the wide square  which had no barrier down the middle For an ordinary joust there would have been a barrier: but in this case the fight was to be a outrance which meant that it might end with swords on foot and so the barrier was left out A pavilion had been erected for the King on one side and another one for the Constable on the other The barricades and the pavilions were decorated with cloth There was a curtained gateway at each end like the dramatic hole through which the circus people ride into their arena In one corner of the corral visible for all to see was a great bundle of faggots with an iron stake in the middle which would not burn or melt This was for the Queen if the law went against her Before Arthur had started his lifes work a man accusing the Queen of anything would have been executed out of hand Now because of his own work he must be ready to burn his wife   For a new Idea had begun to form in the Kongs mind The efforts to dig a channel for Might had failed even when it was turned to the spirit and now he was feeling his way towards abolishing it He had decided not to truckle with Might any more  to cut it out root and branch by establishing another standard altogether He was groping towards Right as a criterion of its own  towards Justice as an abstract thing which did not lean upon power In a few years he would be inventing Civil Law  It was a cold day The cloths strained against the scaffolding of barricade and pavilion and the pennons lay taut on the wind In the corner the executioner blew on his nails standing close to the brazier from which he would take the fire for his bigger blaze The heralds in the Constables pavilion moistened their lips which the breeze was cracking before lifting their trumpets for a fanfare Guenever sitting between guards under the Constables ward had to ask for a shawl The people noticed that she was thinner It was the bleak face of middle age waiting intent and stoical between the beefy faces of the soldiers  Naturally it was Lancelot who rescued her Bors had managed to find him at an abbey during his two days absence and now he came back in the nick of time to fight Sir Mador for the Queen Nobody who knew him would have expected him to do anything else whether he had  been sent away in disgrace or not  but as it was thought that be had left the country his return did have a dramatic quality  Sir Mador came from his recess at the south end of the lists and proclaimed the accusation while his herald blew Sir Bors came from the northern hole to parley with the King and with the Constable  a long indistinct argument or explanation which the people could not catch on account of the wind The spectators became restive wondering what the hitch was and why the trial by battle did not proceed in the usual way Then after several journeys from Kings pavilion to Constables and vice versa Sir Bors returned to his own hole There was an uncomfortable pause during which a black lap dog with a pug nose escaped into the lists and scampered about on some errand best known to itself One of the kings of arms caught it and tied it with his guige for which the people gave him an ironic cheer Then there was silence except for the vendors who were crying nuts and gingerbread  Lancelot rode out from the north exit marked with the Bors escutcheon  and immediately everybody in the amphitheatre knew that it was he although he was disguised The silence was as if everybody had caught their breath simultaneously  He had not come back out of condescension to the Queen The cruel explanation that he had given her up so as to save his soul and that he had now returned from a sense of dramatic magnanimity was not the true one It was more complicated  This knights trouble from his childhood  which he never completely grew out of  was that for him God was a real person He was not an abstraction who punished you if you were wicked or rewarded you if you were good but a real person like Guenever or like Arthur or like anybody else Of course he felt that God was better than Guenever or Arthur but the point was that he was personal Lancelot had a definite idea of what he looked like and how he felt   and he was somehow in love with this Person  The Ill Made Knight was not involved in an Eternal Triangle It was an Eternal Quadrangle which was eternal as well as quadrangular He had not given up his mistress because he was afraid of being punished by some sort of Holy Bogy but he had been confronted by two people whom he loved The one was Arthurs Queen the other a wordless presence who had celebrated Mass at Castle Carbonek Unfortunately as so often happens in love affairs the two objects of his affection were contradictory It was almost as if he had been confronted with a choice between Jane and Janet  and as if he had gone to Janet not because he was afraid that she would punish bun if he stayed with Jane but because he felt with warmth and pity that he loved her best He may even have felt that God needed him more than Guenever did This was the problem an emotional rather than a moral one which had taken him into retreat at his abbey where he had hoped to feel things out Still it would not be quite true to say that he had not come back from some motives of magnanimity He was a magnanimous man He was a maestro Even if Gods need for him was the greater in normal times now it was obvious that his first loves need was pressing Perhaps a man who had left Jane for Janet might have had enough warmth inside him to return for Jane when she was in desperate need and this warmth might be compared to pity or to magnanimity or to generosity  if it were not unfashionable and even a little disgusting to believe in these emotions nowadays Lancelot in any case who was wrestling with his love for Guenever as well as with his love for God came back to her side as soon as he knew that she was in trouble and when he saw her radiant face waiting for him under shameful durance his heart did turn over inside its habergeon with some piercing emotion  call it love or pity whatever you please  Sir Mador de la Fortes heart turned over at the same time  but it was too late to draw back His face went crimson inside its helm where nobody could see it and he felt a warm glow under the straw fillet which padded his skull Then he went back to his own corner and spurred his horse There is something beautiful about the way in which a broken lance sails into the air Down below it on the ground there is much bustle going on The lazy motion with which the lance goes up turning over silently and languidly as it goes contrasts with this It seems superior to earthly considerations and does not seem to be moving fast The fast movement  which was in this case Sir Mador dismounting backwards and upside down  is going on underneath the lance which performs its own independent pirouette in graceful detachment and comes down elsewhere when everybody has forgotten it Sir Madors lance came down on its point by some ballistic freak just behind the king of arms who was holding the black pug When the latter turned round later on and found it upright behind him looking over his shoulder as it were he gave a start  Sir Lancelot dismounted so as not to have the advantage of a horse Sir Mador got up and began doing some wild swipes at the enemy with his sword He was over excited It took two knockouts to finish Sir Mador The first time he was down when Lancelot was coming towards him to accept his surrender he became flustered and thrust at the towering man from below It was a foul blow for it went into the groin from underneath just at the point where armour must necessarily be weakest When Lancelot had withdrawn to let Mador get up if he wanted to go on fighting it was seen that the blood was streaming down his cuisses and greaves There was something terrible about the patient way in which he withdrew although he had been badly stabbed in the thigh If he had lost his temper it would have been easier to bear  The Queens champion knocked Sir Mador down harder the second time Then he jerked off his helm  All right said Sir Mador I give in I was wrong Spare my life  Lancelot did a nice thing Most knights would have been satisfied with winning the Queens case and would have left it at that But Lancelot had a sort of methodical consideration for people  he was sensitive to things which they might be feeling or might be likely to feel  I will spare your life he said only if you promise that nothing is to be written about this on Sir Patricks grave Nothing about the Queen  I promise said Mador  Then while the defeated advocate was being carried away by some leeches Lancelot went to the royal box The Queen had been released immediately and was there with Arthur  Arthur said: Take off your helm stranger  They felt a swelling of love when he took it off and compassion to see the hideous well  known face again while he stood in front of them bleeding hard  Arthur came down from the box He made Guenever get up and took her hand and led her down into the arena He made a regular bow to Sir Lancelot and pulled Guenevers hand so that she curtsied too He did this in front of his people He spoke in the old fashioned talk  and said with a full voice: Sir grant mercy of your great travail that ye have had this day for me and for my Queen Guenever behind his smiling loving face was sobbing as if her heart would burst  38 It so happened that the Patrick accusation was cleared up next day when Nimue arrived with a second sighted explanation Meriyn before letting her lock him up in the cave had given the Matter of Britain into her hands He had made her promise  it was all that he could do  that she would watch over Arthur herself now that she knew his own magic Then he had gone meekly to his imprisonment casting a last long doting look upon her Nimue though scatterbrained and unpunctual was a good girl in her way She turned up a day late told how the apple had come to be poisoned and went back to her own concerns Sir Pinel confirmed the statement by running away the same morning leaving a written confession and everybody had to admit that it was a lucky thing Sir Lancelot had been about  It was not so lucky for the Queen She was alive and saved it was true  but the unbelievable happened In spite of the tears in spite of the fountain of feeling which had sprung between them once again Lancelot persisted in remaining loyal to his Grail  Well for him she exclaimed  she was growing madder every day and it hurt people to watch it  well for him to wrap himself in his new delight He had a grand feeling no doubt a compensation of vigour and clarity and uplifting of the heart Perhaps his famous God did give him something which she could not give Perhaps he was happier with God and would soon begin doing miracles left and right But what about her He was not considering what she got out of God The position was exactly the same she railed at him as if he had left her for another woman He had taken the best of her and now that she was old and worthless he had gone elsewhere He was behaving with the beastly selfishness of Man taking all he could get from one quarter and then when that was used going to another He was a sneak thief And to think that she bad believed in him She did not love him any more now would not let him come near her if he were to pray for it on bended knees As a matter of fact she had despised him even before the search for the Grail began  yes despised him and had determined to throw him over He was not to think that he was deserting her: it was quite the contrary She was tossing him away like a dirty clout because she felt nothing but contempt for him For his poses and swelled head and meanness and childishness and conceit For his futile little God and his goody goody lies To tell him the truth and really she felt no further interest in concealing it there was a young knight at court who was already her lover: had been her lover long before the Grail He was a much finer young man than Lancelot What would she want with a sour husk when she had a rosy boy at her feet who worshipped her yes worshipped the ground she trod on Lancelot had better return to Elaine to the mother of his famous son Perhaps they would be able to say their prayers together one frump with the other frump all night They could talk about their baby their Galahad who had found the loathsome Grail and they could laugh at her if they liked yes they were welcome to laugh at her laughing because she had never managed to bear a son  Then Guenever would begin the laughing  while always one part of her looked out from the eye windows and hated the noise which she was making  and the tears would come after the laughter and she would weep with all her heart  A strange feature was that Arthur who wanted to arrange a tournament in celebration of the Queens acquittal fixed upon a place near Corbin as the spot where the tournament was to be held The place may have been Winchester or Brackley where one of the four surviving English tilting grounds is to be found It does not matter where it was   what does matter is that Corbin was the castle where the now childless Elaine lived out her lonely middle age  I suppose you will go to this tournament asked the Queen fiercely I suppose you will go to be near your trull  Lancelot said: Jenny couldnt you forgive her She is probably ugly as well as miserable now She never had much to fall back on  The generous Lancelotl  If you dont want me to go he said I wont You know I have never loved any human being except you  Only Arthur said the Queen Only Elaine Only God Unless there are some others I havent heard about  Lancelot shrugged bis shoulders  one of the stupidest things to do when the other party wants to have a fight  Are you going he asked  I going Am I to watch you flirting with that turnip Certainly 1 shant go and I forbid you to go either  Very well he said I will tell Arthur that I am ill I could say that my wound has not healed yet  He went to find the King  Everybody had started for the tournament and the court was empty when Guenever changed her mind Perhaps she had kept Lancelot behind so as to be alone with him and finding that it was no good being alone with him had reversed her decision  but we do not know the reason  You had better go she said If I keep you here you will say it was because I was jealous and you will cast it in my teeth Besides there may be a scandal if you stay with me And I dont want you I dont want to see your face Take it away Go  Jenny he said reasonably I cant go now There will be much more of a scandal if I do go after all when I have said that my wound prevents me They will think that we have had a quarrel  Let them think what they please The only thing I tell you is that you are to go before you drive me mad  Jenny he said  He felt that his heart was breaking in two pieces and that the madness which she had given him once before might well be coming again Perhaps she noticed this too At all events she suddenly relented in her manner She saw him off to Corbin with a loving kiss  I promise I wii come back he had said and now he was keeping his promise It was unthinkable that he should go to the tournament without visiting Elaine He had not only promised to return to her but he was the repository of all the last messages of their only son now dead or at least translated The cruellest man could hardly have refused to visit her with such messages  He would lodge at Corbin tell her about Galahad and fight in the tournament disguised He would explain to Arthur that he had pleaded the wound so as to come unexpectedly in disguise because that was one of the new fashioned things to do This subterfuge would be assisted by the fact of his staying at Corbin castle instead of at the actual place of the tournament It would prevent any scandal about a last minute quarrel with the Queen  He was surprised to find as he rode up the avenue to the moat through the cheval de frise that Elaine was waiting for him on the battlements in the same attitude as that in which he had left her twenty years before She met him at the Great Gate  I was waiting for you  She was plump and dumpy now rather like Queen Victoria and she received him faithfully He had said that he would come back and here he was She had expected nothing else  With her next words she stabbed him to the heart  You will be staying for good now said she hardly as a question It was in this way that she had construed his answer when they parted all that time ago  39 If people want to read about the Corbin tournament Malory has it He was a passionate follower of tournaments   like one of those old gentlemen who nowadays frequent the cricket pavilion at Lords  and he may have had access to some ancient Wisden or even to the score books thelmselves He reports the celebrated tournaments in full with the score of each knight and the name of the man who bowled him over or how knocked out But the accounts of old cricket matches are inclined to be boring for those who did not actually play in them so we must leave it unre ported The only things which are apt to be dull in Malory are the detailed score sheets which he gives two or three times  and even they are not dull for anybody who knows the form of the various smaller knights It is sufficient for our purposes to say that Lancelot hit the other side all round the field  his skill had come back to him since the Grail   and that he would have carried his sword after the innings of a lifetime if the wound which he got from Sir Mador had not broken out afresh It is strange that he should have played well on this occasion  for he was distracted by the triple misery of Guenever and God and Elaine  but great performances have been given by others in similiar circumstances Finally when he had made thirty or forty in spite of the old wound (and incidentally he had knocked out Mordred and Agravaine) three knights set upon him at the  same time and the spear of one of them penetrated his defence It broke leaving the head of the spear in his side  Lancelot withdrew from the field while he could still sit his horse and galloped away lolling in the saddle to find a place where he could be alone When he was badly hurt he had this instinct for solitude To him there was something private about death  so that if he had to die he tried to get a chance of doing it by himself Only one knight went with him  he was too weak to shake him off  and it was this knight who helped him to draw the spearhead from his ribs and who eased him when he finally faulted by turning him into the wind It was also this knight who brought the distracted Elaine to his bedside after he had been put to bed  The importance of the Winchester tournament did not lie in any particular feat of arms nor even in Lancelots grievous hurt  for he eventually recovered from it Where it did touch the lives of our four friends was in a circumstance which remains to be told For Lancelot suddenly faced with the unlucky Elaines unfounded conviction that he was going to stay with her for ever had faltered in telling her the truth Perhaps he was a weak man in most ways   weak to have taken Guenever from his best friend in the first place weak to have tried to exchange his mistress for his God and weakest of all to have helped Elaine by telling her he would come back Now in the face of the poor ladys simple hope he had lacked the courage to break her illusion with an immediate blow  One of the troubles in dealing with Elaine in spite of her simplicity or ignorance was that her nature was a sensitive one  more sensitive than Guenevers in fact although she lacked the power of that bold and extraverted queen She had been sensitive enough not to overwhelm him with welcomes when he came home from his long absence: not to reproach him  she had never felt that she had reason to reproach him: and above all not to suffocate him with pity for herself She had held her heart with a firm hand while they waited at Corbin for the tournament carefully hiding the long years during which she had hoped for her lord and her absolute loneliness now that their son was gone Lancelot had known quite well what she was hiding Uncertain and sensitive himself he had forgotten about the way in which their peculiar relationship had started He had begun to blame himself exclusively for Elaines sorrows  So when she did make her small request after having spared him so many tears and welcomes what could he do but seek her pleasure He had still to tell her that her unflinching hope was baseless He was putting it off Feeling like an executioner who knows that he must kiii tomorrow he had tried to give a little joy today  Lance she had said before the tournament asking her strange favour humbly and childishly now that we are together you will wear my token at the fight  Now that we are together And in her tone of voice he had read a picture of twenty years desertion realizing for the first time that during all that period she had been following his career of chivalry like a schoolchild doting on the batsman Hobbs The poor bird had been picturing all the fights   almost certainly picturing them quite wrong: nourishing a starved heart on second hand accounts in secret: wondering whose token was in the place of honour today Perhaps she had been telling herself tor twenty years that some day the great champion would fight under a favour of her own   one of those ridiculous ambitions with which the wretched soul consoles itself tor lack of decent fare  I never wear favours he haid said truthfully  She had not pleaded or complained and she had truly tried to hide her disappointment  I will wear yours he had said immediately I shall be proud to wear it And besides it will help my disguise very much Just because everybody knows that I dont wear favours it will be a splendid disguise to wear one How clever of you to think of it And it will make me fight better What is it to be  It was a scarlet sleeve embroidered with large pearls You can do good embroidery in twenty years  A fortnight after the Winchester tournament while Elaine nursed her hero back to life Guenever was having a scene with Sir Bors at court Being a woman hater Bors always had instructive scenes with women He said what he thought and they said what they thought and neither of them understood the other a bit  Ah Sir Bors said the Queen having sent for him in great haste as soon as she heard about the red sleeve  Bors being one of Lancelots closest relations Ah Sir Bors have ye heard say how falsely Sir Lancelot hath betrayed me  Bors noted that the Queen was nigh out of her mind for wrath blushed deeply and said with exaggerated patience: If anybody has been betrayed it is Lancelot himself He has been mortally wounded by three knights at once  And I am glad cried the Queen glad to hear ill A good thing if he dies He is a false traitor knight  Bors shrugged his shoulders and turned his back as much as to say that he was not going to listen to talk like that The whole of his back as he went to the door showed what he thought about women The Queen rushed after him to retain him by force if necessary She was not going to be cheated of her scene as easily as that  Why should I not call him a traitor she shouted when he bare the red sleeve upon his head at Winchester at the great jousts  Bors afraid that he was going to be physically assaulted said: I am sorry about the sleeve If he had not worn it as a disguise perhaps people would not have set upon him three to one  Fie on him exclaimed the Queen He got a good thrashing anyway in spite of all his pride and boasting He was beaten in fair fight  No he was not It was three to one and his old wound broke out too  Fie on him repeated the Queen I heard Sir Gawaine say in front of the King that it was wonderful how much he loved Elaine  I cant stop Gawaine saying things retorted Sir Bors hotly desperately pathetically furiously and with terror Then he went out and slammed the door leaving the honours about even  At Corbin Elaine and Lancelot were holding hands He smiled feebly at her and said in a pale voice: Poor Elaine  You always seem to be nursing me back from something You never seem to have me except when I am only half alive  I have you for good now she said radiantly  Elaine he said I want to talk to you  40 When the Ill Made Knight came back from Corbin Guenever was still in a rage For some reason she was determined to believe that Elaine had become his mistress again possibly because this seemed to be the best way of hurting her lover She claimed that he had only been pretending about his religious feelings  as was shown by his immediately going off with Elaine when he had the chance This she said had been at the back of his mind all along He was a sham and a weak sham at that They had hysterical scenes together about his weakness and shamness alternating with other scenes of a more affectionate kind which were necessary to counter balance the idea that she had been in love with a sham man all her life She began to look healthier even beautiful again as the result of these quarrels But two lines came between her eyebrows and she had a frightening eye sometimes which glittered like a diamond Lancelot began to have a dogged look They were drifting  Elaine had been explained to and it was Elaine who now struck the only strong blow of her life She struck it unintentionally by committing suicide  A death barge came down the river to the capital since rivers were the highways of the day and it was moored beneath the palace wall She was in it  the plump partridge who had always been helpless Probably people commit suicide through weakness not through strength Her gentle efforts to guide the hand of destiny by decoying her master with feeble tricks or by reticent considerations  these had not been strong enough to be recognized in the despotism of life Her son had gone and her lover and there was nothing left Even the promise to return had failed her futile grasp It had once been something to live for a handrail  not a particularly sumptuous handrail but sufficiently serviceable to keep her upright She had been able to make do Never having been a high handed or demanding girl she had been able to make a little go a long way But now even the little was gone  Everybody went down to see the barge It was not a lily maid of Astolat they saw but a middle aged woman whose hands in stiff looking gloves grasped a pair of beads obediently Death had made her look older and different The stern grey face in the barge was evidently not Elaine  who had gone elsewhere or vanished  Even if Lancelot was a weak man or a games maniac or that infuriating creation a person who consistently tries to be decent he does not seem to have had an easy time of it With his inherited tendency to madness and his fantastic face the confusion of his loyalties and moral standards it must have been difficult enough to keep the balance of life without the various blows which were given to him above the bargain He could have supported even the extra blows if he had been blessed with a callous heart But his heart had been made as a match for  Elaines and now it was unable to bear the burden which hers had been forced to lay down All the things which he might have done for the poor creature but which it was now too late to do and all the shameful questions about responsibility which go with the irrevocable united in his mind  Why were you not kinder to her cried the Queen Why could you not have given her something to live for You might have showed her some bounty and gentleness which would have preserved her life  Guenever who did not yet realize that Elaine had come between them more effectively than ever said this quite spontaneously and she meant it She was overwhelmed with pity for her rival in the barge  41 The new kind of life went on at Camelot in spite of the suicide Nobody could have called it a specially happy kind  but people are tenacious of life and will go on living It was not all of it a plot like life: most of it was just story   one thing after the other  a chain of unnecessary accidents One ridiculous accident which happened about this time is worth mentioning not because it had any consequences or antecedents but because it was somehow the sort of thing which happened to Lancelot He behaved about it in his own way  He was lying on his stomach in a wood one day with what sad thoughts nobody knows when a lady archer came by who was hunting It does not say whether she was a masculine sort of lady with a moustache and gentlemens neckwear or whether she was one of those scatterbrains from the film world who do archery because it is so cute Anyway she saw Lancelot and she thought he was a rabbit On the whole she must have been one of the masculine ladies for although it is a pretty trait to shoot at men in mistake for rabbits it would nave been unusual for a film star to hit the mark Lancelot bounding to his feet with about six inches of arrow embedded in his rump behaved exactly like Colonel Bogey   driven into on the second tee at golf He said passionately: Lady or damsel what that thou be in an evil time bare ye a bow; the devil made you a shooter  In spite of the wound in his backside Lancelot fought in the next tournament  an important one because of several things which happened at it The true tension at court   which was apparent to everybody except Lancelot who was too innocent to be conscious of such things  began to show itself clearly at the Westminster jousts For one thing Arthur began to assert his position in their wretched triangle He did this poor fellow by suddenly taking the opposite side to Lancelot in the grand mï¿½lï¿½e He set upon his best friend and tried to hurt him and lost his temper He did nothing unknightly and as it happened did no harm to Lancelot But the strange turn of feeling was there all the same Before and afterward they were friends But just for that one moment of anger Arthur was the cuckold and Lancelot his betrayer Such is the apparent explanation  an unconscious recognition of their relationship  but there may have been another thought behind it It was a long time since Arthur had been the happy Wart long since his home and his kingdom had been at their fortunate peak Perhaps he was tired of the struggle tired of the Orkney clique and the strange new fashions and the difficulties of love and modern justice He may have fought against Lancelot in the hope of being killed by him  not a hope exactly not a conscious attempt This just and generous and kind hearted man may have guessed unconsciously that  the only solution for him and for his loved ones must lie in his own death  after which Lancelot could marry the Queen and be at peace with God  and he may have given Lancelot the chance of killing him in fair fight because he himself was worn out It may have been At all events nothing came of it There was the blaze of temper and then their love was fresh again  Another important feature of the tournament was that Lancelot with innocent idiocy alienated the Orkneys finally and for good He unhorsed the whole clan except Gareth one after the other and Mordred and Agravaine he unhorsed twice Only a saint could have been fool enough to have saved their lives so often in rescues from Dolorous Towers and so on   but to cap it by knocking them down at will at such a time was the policy of a natural Gawaine it is true was decent enough to refuse to have a hand in plots against Lancelots life and Gaheris was dull But from this day on it was only a question of time as between the fashionable party of Mordred and Agravaine and the safety of the commander in chief  A third straw in the wind was that Gareth fought on Lancelots side at Westminster The peculiar cross plays of sentiment were noticed by everybody  the King against his second self and Gareth against his own brothers With such an undertow there was evidently a storm to come It came characteristically from a quarter which nobody had suspected  There was a cockney knight called Sir Meliagrance who had never been happy at court If he had lived in the earlier days when a man was judged as a man he might have got along well enough Unfortunately he belonged to the later generation of Mordreds fashions and he was judged by the new standards Everybody knew that Sir Meliagrance was not quite out of the top drawer He knew it himself  the top drawer had been invented by Mordred  and the knowledge did not make him happy Beside all this Sir Meliagrance had a special cause for misery which had poisoned society for him He was desperately hopelessly  and had been ever since he could remember  in love with Guenever  The news came while Arthur and Lancelot were at the nine pin alley They had got into the habit of going off to this unfashionable spot every day to cheer thelmselves with a little conversation  Arthur was saying: No no Lance You never understood poor Tristram at all  He was a cad said Lancelot obstinately  They were talking in the past tense because Tristram had finally been murdered while playing the harp to La Beale Isoud by the exasperated King Mark  Even if he is dead added the knight  But the King shook his head vehemently  Not a cad he said He was a buffoon one of the great comic characters He was always getting himself into extraordinary situations  A buffoon  Absent minded said the King That is the great comic affliction Look at his love affairs  You mean Isoud White Hands  I firmly believe that Tristram got those two girls completely mixed up He goes mad on La Beale Isoud and then forgets all about her One day he is getting into bed with the other Isoud when something about the action reminds him of something It dawns on him that there are two Isouds not one  and he is terribly upset about it Here am I getting into bed with Isoud White Hands he says when all the time I was in love with La Beale Isoud Naturally he was upset And then being nearly murdered in his bath by the Queen of Ireland There was a light of high comedy about that young man and you ought to forgive him for being a cad  I  began Lancelot but at that moment the messenger arrived  He was a small breathless boy with an arrow slit in his jupon under the right armpit He held the rent together with his fingers and talked fast  It was about the Queen who had gone a Maying  for it was the first of May She had started early as the custom was intending to be back by ten oclock with all the dewy primroses and violets and hawthorn blooms and green budding branches which it was proper to gather on such a morning She had left her bodyguard behind  the Queens knights who all bore the vergescu as their badge of office   and had taken with her only ten knights in civilian clothes They had been dressed in green to celebrate the festival of spring Agravaine was among them  he had attached himself to Guenever lately to spy on her  and Lancelot had been left out on purpose  Well they had been riding home cheerfully all chattering and bloomy and branchy whea Sir Meliagrance had leaped up at their feet in an ambush The top drawer business had preyed on his mind till he had determined to be ungentlemanly in earnest if everybody accused him of being so He had known that the Queens party was unarmed and that Lancelot was not with them He had brought a strong force of archers and men at arms to take her captive There had been a fight The Queens knights had defended her as best they could with swords and falchions until they were all wounded six of them seriously Then Guenever had surrendered to save their lives She had made a bargain with Sir Meliagrance  whose heart was not really in the business of being a blackguard  that if she called her defenders off he must promise to take the wounded knights with her to his castle and he must let them sleep in the anteroom of her chamber Meliagrance loving Guenever flinching at his own half  hearted wickedness and knowing the hopelessness of forcing his beloved against her will had agreed to terms The poor fellow had never been cut out to be a villain  In the confusion of getting the sorry procession of hurt men slung across their horses the Queen had kept her head She had beckoned the little page who had a fresh and fast pony and she had secretly slipped him her ring with a message for Lancelot When he saw his opportunity he was to gallop for his life  and he had done so with the archers after him Here was the ring  Lancelot half way through the story was already shouting for his armour By the time it was told Arthur was kneeling at his feet strapping on the greaves  42  When the mounted archers rode back crestfallen saying that they had been unable to shoot the boy Sir Melia gnnce knew what was going to happen He was distracted with misery not only because he knew that he had been acting unwisely and wickedly but also because he was genuinely in love with the Queen He still had a kick in him however and he saw that after having gone so far it was too late to retreat Lancelot would be bound to come in answer to the message and it was necessary to gain time The castle was not ready for a siege  but if it could be got ready there would be a fair prospect of making terms with the besiegers considering that the Queen would be inside So Lancelot must be stopped at all costs until the castle had been put in posture of defence He guessed correctly that Lancelot would come riding helter skelter to the Queens aid as soon as he could get himself armed The best way of stopping him would be with a second ambush at a narrow glade in the wood which he would have to ride through  a glade so narrow that archers would certainly be able to kill his horse if not to pierce his armour Since the Troubled Tunes all roads had been cleared of undergrowth for the distance of a bowshot on either side  but this glade on account of peculiarities in the terrain had been overlooked And a well shot arrow at fair range could penetrate the best armour as Meliagrance knew  So the ambush was sent out post haste and everything within the castle was at sixes and sevens Herdsmen were driving beasts into the keep  and all the beasts strayed or got muddled with each other or would not go through gates Pump boys were feverishly bringing water to the great tubs   it was one of those futile castles which appear to have originated in Ireland whose bailey was without a well Maids were running about on the verge of hysterics  for Sir Meliagrance like many people out of the wrong drawer was determined to receive his captive Queen in a way which would be above criticism They were making boudoirs for her and taking the tapestries out of his bachelor bedroom to go in hers and polishing the silver and sending to the nearest neighbours for the loan of gold plate Guenever herself ushered into a small waiting room while the state apartments were made ready for her reception added to the confusion by insisting on bandages and hot water and stretchers for her wounded men Sir Meliagrance running up and down stairs with cries of Yes Maam in arf a minute or Marian Marian where the ell have you put the candles or Murdoch take them sheep out of the solar this instant found time to lean his forehead against the cold stone of an embrasure to clutch his bewildered heart to curse his folly and further to disarrange his already disordered plots  The Queen was the first to get her affairs in order She only had the bandaging to arrange and naturally her wants were the earliest to be attended She was sitting with her waiting women at one of the windows of the castle a sort of calm centre in the middle of the whirlwind when one of the girls called out that something was coming down the road  It is a cart said the Queen It will be something to do with the provisions of the castle  There is a knight in the cart said the girl a knight in armour I suppose somebody is taking him away to be hanged  In those days it was considered disgraceful to ride in a cart  Later they saw that there was a horse trotting behind the cart  which was coming at a great gallop  with its reins dangling in the dust Later still they were horrified to see that all the entrails of the horse were dangling in the dust also It was stuck full of arrows like a porcupine and trotted along with a strange look of unconcernedness Perhaps it was numbed  by shock It was Lancelots horse and Lancelot was in the cart beating the cart horse with his scabbard He had fallen into the ambush as expected had spent some time trying to get at his assailants  who had escaped the heavy dismounted iron man easily by jumping over hedges and ditches  and then he had set out to walk the rest of the way in spite of his armour Meliagrance had counted on the impossibility of such a walk for a man dressed in an equipment which may have weighed as much as himself  but he had not counted on the cart which Lancelot commandeered A measure of the great mans anxiety about the Queen on this occasion is that he is said to have swum his horse across the Thames at the beginning of the ride from Westminster Bridge to Lambeth in spite of the fact that if anything had gone wrong his armour would certainly have drowned him  How dare you say it was a knight going to be hanged exclaimed the Queen You are a hussy How dare you compare Sir Lancelot to a felon  The wretched girl blushed and held her tongue while Lancelot could be seen throwing his reins to the terrified carter and storming up the drawbridge shouting at the top of his voice  Sir Meliagrance heard of the arrival just as Lancelot was bursting in at the Great Gate A flustered porter taken by surprise tried to shut it in his face but received a blow on the ear from the iron fist which knocked him flat The gate swung open undefended Lancelot was in one of his rare passions possibly on account of the sufferings of his horse  Meliagrance who had been overseeing some men at arms while they broke up the wooden sheds on the Great Court as a precaution against Greek Fire lost his nerve He sprinted for the back stairs and was already kneeling at the Queens feet while Lancelot was raging round the Porters lodge demanding the Queen  What is the matter now asked Guenever looking at the extraordinary vulgar man who sprawled before her   a look curiously enough not without affection After all it is a compliment to be kidnapped for love especially when all ends happily  I yield I yield cried Sir Meliagrance Ow I yield to you dear Queen Save me from that Sir Lancelot  Guenever was looking radiantly beautiful It may have been the Maying or the compliment which the cockney Knight had paid her or some premonition such as comes to women before their joy At any rate she was feeling happy and she bore no gradge against her captor  Very well she said cheerfully and wisely The less noise there is about this the better for my reputation 1 will try to calm Sir Lancelot  Sir Meliagrance positively whistled with relief he sighed so hard  Thats right he said Thats the old cock sparrer   ahem ahem Beg pardon Im sure Will it please your gracious Majesty to stye the night at Meliagrance Castle when you ave been and calmed Sir Lancelot for the sike of your wounded knights  I dont know said the Queen  You could all go awai in the morning urged Sir Meliagrance and we could sye no more abaht it It would be more regular like You could sye you was here on a visit  Very well said the Queen and she went down to Lancelot while Sir Meliagrance mopped his brow  He was standing in the Inner Court shouting for his enemy When Guenever saw him and he saw her the old electric message went between their eyes before they spoke a word It was as if Elaine and the whole Quest for the Grail had never been So far as we can make it out she had accepted her defeat He must have seen in her eyes that she had given in to him that she was prepared to leave him to be himself  to love his God and to do whatever he pleased    so long as he was only Lancelot She was serene and sane again She had renounced her possessive madness and was joyful to see him living whatever he did They were young creatures  the same creatures whose eyes had met with the almost forgotten click of magnets in the smoky Hall of Camelot so long ago And in truly yielding she had won the battle by mistake  What is all the fuss about asked the Queen  They had a light bantering tone They were in love again  You may well ask  Then he added in an angrier voice and flushing: He has shot my horse  Thank you for coming said the Queen Her voice was gentle It was the first voice he remembered Thank you for coming so fast and so bravely But he has given in and we must forgive him  It was shameful to murder my poor horse  We have made it up  If I had known you were going to make it up said Lancelot rather jealously I would not have nearly killed myself in coming  The Queen took his bare hand The gauntlet was off  Are you sorry she asked because you have done so well  He was silent  I dont care about him said the Queen blushing I only thought it would be better not to have a scandal  I dont want a scandal any more than you do  You must do as you please said the Queen Fight him if you like You are the one to choose  Lancelot looked at her  Madam he said so ye be pleased I care not As for my part ye shall soon please  He always fell into the grandeur of the High Language when he was moved  43 The wounded knights were laid on stretchers in the outer room The inner room where Guenever slept had a window with iron bars There was no glass  Lancelot had noticed a ladder in the garden which was long enough for his purpose  and although they had made no assignation the Queen was waiting When she saw his crumpled face at the window with the inquisitive nose against the stars she did not think it was a gargoyle or a demon She stood for a few heartbeats feeling the wild blood surge in her neck then went silently to the window   the silence of an accomplice  Nobody knows what they said to each other Malory says that they made either to other their complaints of many divers things Probably they agreed that it was impossible to love Arthur and also to deceive him Probably Lancelot made her understand about his God at last and she made him understand about her missing children Probably they fully agreed to accept their guilty love as ended  Later Sir Lancelot whispered: I wish I might come in  I would as fain  Would you madam with all your heart that I were with you  Truly  The last iron bar as he broke it out cut the brawn of his hand to the bone  Later still the whispers faltered and there was silence in the darkness of the room  Queen Guenever lay long in bed next morning Sir Meliagrance anxious to get the whole affair safely ended as soon as possible fussed in the antechamber wishing she were gone For one thing he was not anxious to prolong his own torture by keeping the Queen under his roof whom he loved and could not have  At last partly to hurry her off and partly out of a lovers uncontrollable curiosity he went into the bedroom to wake her up  a proceeding which was possible in the days of the levee  Mercy said Sir Meliagrance what ails you Maam to sleep so long  He was looking at his lost beauty in the bed and pretending not to do so The blood of Lancelots cut hand was all over the sheets  Traitress cried Sir Meliagrance suddenly Traitress You are a traitor to King Arthur  He was beside himself with rage and jealousy believing himself deceived He had been assuming since his own enterprise had gone agley that the Queen was a pure woman; and that he in seeking to enjoy her was in the wrong Now he saw that all the time she had been cheating him only pretending to be too virtuous to love him and meanwhile sporting with her wounded knights under his very nose He had jumped to the conclusion that the blood had come from a wounded knight  otherwise why should she have insisted on having them in the antechamber The wildest envy was mixed with his rage He never saw the bars of the window which had been replaced as carefully as possible  Traitress Traitress I accuse you of high treason  The yells of Sir Meliagrance brought the hurt knights hobbling to the door  the commotion spread  tire women and serving maids pages turf boys a couple of grooms all came with excitement to the scene  They are all false cried Sir Meliagrance all or some A wounded knight hath been here  Guenever said That is untrue They can prove it  It is a lie the knights shouted Choose which of us you will fight We will fight you  No you wont yelled Sir Meliagrance Away with your proud language A wounded knight as been sleeping with er Majesty  And he kept on pointing to the blood which was certainly good evidence until Sir Lancelot arrived among the now sheepish bodyguard Nobody noticed that his hand was in a glove  What is the matter asked Lancelot  Meliagrance began telling him wildly gesticulating seizing with excitement upon a fresh person to tell He was like a man crazy with grief  Lancelot said coldly: May I remind you about your own conduct towards the Queen  I dont know what you mean I dont care I know a knight was in this room last evening  Be careful what you say  Lancelot looked at him hard trying to warn him and to bring him to his senses They both knew that this accusation must end in trial by combat and Lancelot wanted to make him realize with whom he would have to fight Sir Meliagrance did realize this eventually He looked at Lancelot with unexpected dignity  And you be careful too Sir Lancelot he said quietly I know you are the best knight in the world but be careful ow you fight in a wrong quarrel God might strike a stroke for justice Sir Lancelot after all  The Queens true lover set his teeth  That must be left to God he said  Then he added very meanly: So far as I am concerned I say plainly that none of these wounded knights was in the Queens room And if you want to fight about it I will fight you  Lancelot was in the end to fight for the Queen at the stake three times: first in the good quarrel of Sir Mador second in this very doubtful quibble of words with Sir Meliagrance and third in a quarrel which was wrong altogether  and each fight brought them nearer to destruction  Sir Meliagrance threw down his glove He was so certain of the truth of his assertion that he had become obstinate as people do in violent arguments He was prepared to die rather than withdraw Lancelot took the glove  what else could he do Everybody began attending to the paraphernalia of a challenge the usual sealing of the gages with signets and so on and the fixing of the date Sir Meliagrance grew quieter Now that he was caught in the machinery of justice he had time to reflect and as usual his reflections went the opposite way He was an inconsistent man  Sir Lancelot he said now that we are fixed to have a fight you wont do nothing treacherous to me meanwhile  Of course not  Lancelot looked at him in genuine amazement His heart was like Arthurs He was always getting himself into trouble  as for instance by unhorsing the Orkneys at Westminster   through underestimating the wickedness of the world  We will be friends till the battle  The old warrior felt his long accustomed pang of shame He was to fight this man for saying what was practically true  Yes he said enthusiastically friends  He moved towards Meliagrance with an uprush of remorse  Then we will have peace for now said Meliagrance in a pleased voice Everything above  board Would you like to see my castle  Indeed I should  Meliagrance led him all over the castle from room to room until they came to a chamber with a trap door The board rolled and the trap opened Lancelot fell sixty feet landing on deep straw in a dungeon Then Meliagrance ordered one of the horses to be hidden and went back to the Queen to tell her that her champion had ridden ahead Lancelots well known habit of abrupt departures lent colour to the story It seemed to Meliagrance the best way of ensuring that God should not choose the wrong side of this quarrel  for Meliagrance was muddled with his standards too  44  The second trial by combat was as sensational as the Mador one had been For one thing Lancelot arrived at the last moment by a still narrower margin They had waited for him and given him up and persuaded Sir Lavine to fight in his place Sir Lavme was actually riding into the lists when the great man came at full gallop on a white horse which belonged to Meliagrance He had been held captive in the dungeon until that morning  when the girl who brought him his food had finally liberated him in the absence of her master in exchange for a kiss He had suffered some complicated scruples about this kiss: but had decided in the end that it was permissable  Meliagrance went down at the first charge and refused to get up  I yield he said Im a gonner  Get up get up You have not fought at all  I shant said Sir Meliagrance  Lancelot stood over him in perplexity He owed him a thrashing for the business of the horse and for the treachery of the trap door But he knew that the mans accusation was essentially right and he did not like the idea of killing him  Mercy said Sir Meliagrance  Lancelot turned his eyes sideways to the Queens pavilion where she sat under the Constables ward Nobody could see this look of inquiry because of the great helm  Guenever saw it however or felt it in her heart She turned her thumb down over the edge of the box and secretly jabbed it downward several tunes Meliagrance she thought was a dangerous man to keep alive  There was great silence in the arena while everybody waited without breath leaning forward and looking upon the combatants like a circle of vultures whose prey is not yet dead Everybody was waiting for the coup de grace like the people at a Roman amphitheatre or at a Spanish bull fight and everybody was sure that Lancelot would give it The accusation of Meliagrance had been in their opinion much more serious than the accusation of Mador   and they thought like Guenever that he deserved to perish For in those days love was ruled by a different convention to ours In those days it was chivalrous adult long religious almost platonic It was not a matter about which you could make accusations lightly It was not as we take it to be nowadays begun and ended in a long week end  The spectators saw Lancelot hesitating over the man then heard his voice coming muffled by the helm He was making proposals  I will give you odds he was saying if you will get up and fight me properly to the death I will take off my helm and all the armour on the left side of my body and I will fight without a shield with my left hand tied behind my back That will be fair surely Will you get up and fight me like that  A sort of high hysterical squeal came from Sir Meliagrance who could be seen crawling towards the Kings box and making violent gestures  Dont forget what e said he was shouting Everybody eard im I accept is terms Dont let im go back on em No harmour for the left side no shield or elm and is left hand tied behind is back Everybody eard Everybody eard  The King cried Ho and abide The heralds and kings at arms came down the lists and Meliagrance was silenced Everybody felt shame on his behalf In the distasteful stillness while he muttered and insisted that the terms should be observed reluctant hands disarmed Sir Lancelot and tied him They felt they were helping at the execution of somebody whom they loved very much for the odds were too heavy When they had bound him and given him his sword they patted him  pushing him forward towards Meliagrance with these rough pats and turning away their faces  There was a flash in the sandy lists like a salmon jumping a weir It was Lancelot showing his naked side to draw the blow And as the blow came there was the click of changing forms  the same click as comes in the kaleidoscope when the image alters The blow which Meliagrance was giving had changed to a blow which Lancelot was giving Sir Meliagrance was dragged out of the field by horses His helm and head were in two pieces  45 Well that is the long story of how the foreigner from Benwick stole Queen Guenevers love of how he left her for his God and finally returned in spite of the taboo It is a story of love in the old days when adults loved faithfully  not a story of the present in which adolescents pursue the ignoble spasms of the cinematograph These people had struggled for a quarter of a century to reach their understanding and now their Indian Summer was before them Lancelot had given his God to Guenever and she had given him his freedom in exchange Elaine who had never been more than an incidental part of the muddle had achieved a peace of her own Arthur whose corner of the triangle was the least fortunate from a personal point of view was not entirely wretched Merlyn had not intended him for private happiness He had been made for royal joys for the fortunes of a nation These for the time of their sunset Lancelots two sensational victories had restored Fashion and modernity and the rot at the Tables heart were in hiding and his great idea was on the move once more He was inventing Law as Power Nor had Arthur cause for private reproach He had kept himself aloof from the pains of Guenever and Lancelot unconsciously trusting them not to bring the matter to his consciousness not from motives of fear or of weak connivance but from the noblest of motives The power had been in the Kings hands He had been in the position of a husband who could by a single command solve the problem of eternal triangles by reference to the headsmans block or to the stake His wife and her lover had been at his mercy  and that was the reason not any reason of cowardice why his generous heart had been determined to remain unconscious  The Indian Summer was within their grasp gossip was silenced discourtesy put down The Orkney faction could only grumble a distant and almost subterranean complaint In the scriptoria of the abbeys and in the castles of the great nobles the harmless writers scribbled away at Missals and Treatises of Knighthood while the limners illuminated the capital letters and carefully drew blazons of arms The goldsmiths and silversmiths hammered away with small hammers at gold leaf They twisted gold wire and inlaid interlacements of the wildest complexity on the crosiers of the bishops Pretty ladies kept robins and sparrows for pets or tried very hard to teach their magpies to talk Housewives of a provident turn of mind filled their cupboards with treacle as a medicine for bad air and with home made plasters called  Flos Unguentorum for the rheumatics and musk balls to smell They provided against Lent by purchasing dates and green ginger of almonds and herrings at 4s 6d the horse load Falconers and austringers abused each others hawks to their hearts content In the new law courts  for Fort Mayne was over  the lawyers were as busy as bees issuing writs for attainder chancery chevisance disseisin distraint distress embracery exigent fieri facias maintenance replevin right of way oyer and terminer scot and lot Quorum bonorum Sic et non Pro et contra Jus primae noctis and Questio quid juris Thieves  it is true  could be hanged for stealing goods to the value of one shilling   for the codification of Justice was still weak and muddled   but that was not so bad as it sounds when you remember that for a shilling you could buy two geese or four gallons of wine or forty eight loaves of bread  a troublesome load for a thief in any case In the country lanes the mere lovers who were not gentles walked in the sunsets with their arms round each others waists so that they gave the impression of a capital X when seen from behind  Arthurs Gramarye was at peace and the joys of peace stretched before Lancelot and Guenever But there was a fourth corner in the puzzle  God was Lancelots totem He was the other person of their battle and now He chose the final moment to step across the path The small boy who looked in the kettle hat and who dreamed of well water which always slipped away from his lips had cherished an ambition to do some ordinary miracle He had managed a sort of miracle when he rescued Elaine from her tub by being the best knight in the world  before he was trapped by Elaine on that terrible evening so that he broke his taboo For a quarter of a century he had remembered the night with grief and it had been with him through all the searches for the Grail Before it he had thought himself a man of God Since then he had been a swindle Now the time had finally come to a head when he was to be forced to face his doom  There was a knight from Hungary called Sir Urre who had received wounds in a tournament seven years before He had been fighting with a man called Sir Alphagus whom he had killed after getting these wounds  three of them on the head four on the body and on the left hand The mother of the dead Alphagus had been a Spanish witch and she had put an enchantment on Sir Urre of Hungary so that none of the wounds could ever heal up All the time they were to go on bleeding turn about until the best knight in the world had tended them and salved them with his hands  Sir Urre of Hungary had long been carried from country to country  perhaps it was a sort of hemophilia  searching for the best knight who would be able to help him At last he had braved the channel to reach this foreign northern land Everybody had told him everywhere that his only chance was Lancelot and in the end he had come to seek  Arthur who always felt the best of everybody was sure that Lance would be able to do it   but he thought it fair that every knight of the Table should have a try There might be a hidden excellence lurking somewhere as had happened before  The court was at Carlisle at the time for the feast of Pentecost and it was arranged that everybody should meet in the town meadow Sir Urre was carried there in a litter and laid on a cushion of gold cloth for the attempt at healing to begin A hundred and ten knights  forty were away on quests  stood round him in ordered ranks in their best clothes and there were carpets laid down and pavilions set up for the great ladies to watch Arthur loved his  Lancelot so much that he wanted him to have a splendid setting in which his crowning achievement could be done  This is the end of the book of Sir Lancelot and now we are to see him for the last time in it He was hiding in the harness room of the castle whence he could spy the field There were plenty of leather reins in the room hanging orderly among the saddles and the bright bits He had noticed that they were strong enough to bear his weight He was waiting there hidden praying that somebody  Gareth perhaps  would be able to do the miracle quickly: or if not that they would overlook him that his absence would not be noticed  Do you think it would be fine to be the best knight in the world Think then also how you would have to defend the title Think of the tests such repeated remorseless scandal  breathing tests which day after day would be applied to you  until the last and certain day when you would fail Think also that you know of a good reason for your failure which you have tried to hide tried pathetically to hide and overlook for five and twenty years Think that you are now to go out before the largest and most honourable gallery that can be assembled to make a public demonstration of your sin They are expecting you to succeed and you are to fail: you are to publish the deceit which you have practised for a quarter of a century and they will all immediately know the reason for it  that reason of shame which you have sought to conceal from your own mind and which when it has remembered itself in the silence of your empty chamber has pricked you into a physical motion of your head to throw it off Miracles which you wanted to do so long ago can only be done by the pure in heart The people outside are waiting for you to do this miracle because you have traded on their belief that your heart was pure   and now with treachery and adultery and murder wringing the heart like a cloth you are to go out into the sunlight for the test of honour  Lancelot stood in the harness room as white as a sheet Guenever was out there he knew and she was also pale He twisted his fingers and looked at the strong reins and prayed as best he could  Sir Servause le Breuse cried the heralds and Sir Servause stepped forward  a knight far down the list of competitors He was a shy man interested only in natural history who had never fought with anybody in his life He went over to Sir Urre who was groaning from all the handling and he knelt down and did his best
